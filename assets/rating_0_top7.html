      <td>Just an observation, so I will not rate.  I followed this procedure with strawberries instead of raspberries.  Perhaps this is the reason it did not work well.  Sorry to report that the strawberries I did in August were moldy in October.  They were stored in my downstairs fridge, which is very cold and infrequently opened.  Delicious and fresh-tasting prior to that, though.  So, keep a sharp eye on them.  Personally I would not keep them longer than a month.  This recipe also appears as #120345 posted in July 2009, which is when I tried it.  I also own the Edna Lewis cookbook in which this appears.</td>

      <td>Made my own buttermilk w/ vinegar and milk.  Used defrosted fresh skinless/boneless chicken fillets.  3 lbs.\r\nThis mix is extremely flavorful and its light .  I didnt do the bbq thing, but while I cooked homemade to go w/ this I put the chicken in the oven to keep warm and served bbq dipping sauce.  10 stars from my kids !</td>

      <td>I used half cream and half 1% milk, added another 1/2c cream at the end. Was without nutmeg. Added nearly a whole pkg of bacon and two 6 oz cans of crab. I will come back to rate this after I make it again using all the posted ingredients. Really yummy, I need to add the nutmeg and see what that does to the flavor.</td>

      <td>FABULOUS!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I could not afford any of the ingredients, so I just used what I had in my kitchen and that is the creamed corn. I warmed it up on medium heat for a few minutes and pretended that I was eating the Potato-Crab Chowder. UNBELIEVABLE! Thanks for this recipe.</td>

      <td>Awesome chowder! I used both canned and imitation crab. The second added a lot of flavor. I added Old Bay Seasoning as well. Truly yummy!</td>
