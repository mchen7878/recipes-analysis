      <td>What a disastrous recipe.  We used fat free yogurt instead of low fat yogurt which could have been the problem, but our concoction was anything but frozen yogurt.  It took a long time for it to finally become a consistency other than regular yogurt.  When it finally did harden, it was like eating flakes of sorbet. Very disappointing.  We will never use this recipe again.  However, we still are looking for a good fat free frozen yogurt recipe, if anyone has any suggestions.  But please, don't make the same mistake we did by using this unsuccessful recipe.</td>

The only thing it did was waste a perfectly good package of cheese. and one other thing is that there should be some type of coating on the outside of them to get them crispy. we also think there should be sour cream in the batter, it would help them hold togeather and give them a creamier flavor.</td>

I mixed it up as specified except that I used a Gluten free flour mix and xanthum gum--that could be the problem but I don't think so I have made other donut and funnel cake recipes using the same flour and not had any trouble.  The dough was strange almost elastic and a little like that  cornstarch and water mixture from middle school science.  When we tried to fry them the dough just  sort of bubble apart.  I hate wasting anything so we tried to roll them in flour with the same results then we dipped them in egg wash and rolled them in cookie crumbs same result, finally we rolled them in to balls and baked at 400 f for about 7 minutes the results we a crisp sweet shortbreadish cookie.   As a cookie they probably got a 4 but it just didn't work out as doughnuts.</td>

I have the following remarks:&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;1) If you preserve tomatoes in the fridge after cutting them they will lose their scent. Tomato should be served fresh.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;2) The same happens with oregano, which should be poured on top of the salad fresh.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;3) Balsamic vinegar has nothing to do with Greeks and greek tomato salad.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The only Greek Salad I know that is marinated and preserved in the fridge, is the &amp;quot;Politiki Salata&amp;quot;, Salad from Constantinopolis, widely served in north Greece and Thessaloniki. You can find this recipe in this link: http://www.greek-recipe.com/salad-from-constantinopolis/&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;I do not doubt that this could be a nice salad, although I expressed my concerns especially about preserving cut tomatoes in the fridge but definitely is not a Greek Salad.</td>

The texture is like foam rubber. And it tastes like it was made with fish oil. I could've predicted this outcome just from the ingredients but I thought I'd give it a try.

We were skeptical when the recipe told us to add the lemon &amp; herb mixture to 2 cups of water, and with good reason: we ended up with a watery broth that the recipe was instructing us to pour over the fish - which didn't make sense to us at all. We felt it would have made more sense to cook the fish in the broth rather than pour it over top.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So we tried it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The problem is: we tasted the broth, while the fish was boiling in it, and it tasted horrible! Needless to say we did our best to salvage the fish before it could be completely tainted. The flavors of the garlic, lemon and herbs did not compliment each other.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take one bad taste, add a set of ambiguous instructions and one spoiled dinner: and you get a recipe we will never attempt or recommend ever again.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Take our advice: stay away from this recipe!</td>

I thought perhaps the package of onion soup had somehow gone bad, so I threw out the gravy, rinsed off the roast and made the gravy again, this time with beef stock instead of onion soup.  Same mouldy taste.  I used a generic blue brand of cola from a big supermarket which I sampled before adding, and it was fine, so I'm thinking there was some kind of weird reaction between it and the mushroom soup. The roast beef itself was very tender though.  I will probably try this again, but without the mushroom soup.</td>

After mixing the dry ingredients I tasted them with a finger tip and knew that the molasses alone wasn't going to be enough to flavor them. I added a 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4  tsp each ginger and mace. Moving on to the wet ingredients, the amount given wasn't even close to being enough. I ended up using 3/4 cup of milk and it was still pretty stiff with that much but at the same time quite sticky. I patted and cut 7 scones (not 14) and the dough was used up. I had tasted a pinch on the dough before cutting and it would benefited from 1/3 (or more if you like sweet) cup of sugar or Splenda being added to the flour mix. In an effort to help them out I washed the tops with egg white and covered them heavily with sugar. In baking I watched them like a hawk and removed them as soon as they were ready. Even though fully baked they retained a gummy texture inside. I'm sorry but I won't try these again. Made for PAC, Fall '09.</td>

      <td>I hate to do this as a first review on this site, but it is not anything like a Tempura Batter.  We had a Dinner party party last night, with 10 guests. Like always, sometimes stupid me, decided to try a new recipe. Lucky for us for the Tempura, decided to make a test batch first, before I did the 4 lbs of Large shrimp, and the Veggies in it. I should have looked at the pics first, not tempura. Cooked a couple of shrimp and a few veggies, started over with a real tempura batter.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;The batter was more like a batter you would use if your making something like sweet and sour pork or chicken. Actually it might work very well for that. I followed the recipe to a tee, didn&amp;#039;t understand the egg or the cornstarch, but did it anyway.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;I do have a really good tempura batter, that I use a couple of times a month, and never fails.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Anyway the dinner came out great, Tempura, Steak, Rice, Fruit, and a few bottles of beer.  I did save the batter until later and chopped a bunch of the veggies, some smaller shrimp I had added some spices and bean sprouts and made little pancakes out of them. They came out good. But all and all its a batter that is more suited to a chinese type meal than a japanese.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;One other point, when you make tempura, make sure the oil is almost at the smoking point, and the batter is Ice cold, when you place a few pieces at a time in the oil. Also if you use really good fresh seafood and veggies, don&amp;#039;t season the batter, let the natural flavors come through. The dipping sauces are for flavoriny if you need additional.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Sorry Karen,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Just didn&amp;#039;t like it.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Peace Out,&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Frank and Spanky</td>

I let the mixtue sit about an hour before I tasted it, and the cucumbers were still so salty they were inedible.  To try and save it I rinsed out the marinade, poured fresh water over, let it stand about 1/2 hour, and then tasted it again.

This "pesto" had "a taste", namely cilantro, but was not tasty, and unfortunately did very little to flavor this dish.  What this dish really needs is a more genuine stuffing within the pork, and this pesto should be prepared separately and poured atop the cooked meat to add more dynamic flavor.  A little bit of seasoning during prep wouldn't hurt either, to help flavor the meat.

      <td>The topping was great, no doubt (but does it really count as a recipe, just melted caramels and bagged coconut?).  The cookie base is a disaster?meant to be shortbread, I think, it is a dry, floury mouthful lacking in the buttery richness needed in a shortbread.  (note that one of the 5-star reviews does not follow the recipe for the base, and uses sugar cookie dough instead).  The base is too tender to hold up to the caramel topping, so when you cut these, the bottom crumbles. Icing the powdery bottom is frustrating and messy.  I would actually recommend using something more like a Walker?s shortbread (or even USE Walker?s cookies!).  Pure melted chocolate, while fine for icing the bottoms of the bars, is too thick to drizzle.  Choose a chocolate wisely, as the flavor predominates--I agree with the one review that recommends not icing the bottoms at all.  And lastly, I made the grave error of making these for a party without trying the recipe first.  The kids and guest seemed to like them, but I got no ?OMG? comments.</td>

So neither were truly reviewing this recipe &amp;quot;as is&amp;quot;  There were thickening issues on both the guava base for the frosting as well as the guava frosting.  I had to add arrowroot just to salvage the recipe.  Maybe using the strawberry guava is the trick, because straight guava made for a very bland (and not at all sweet) cake and guava topping.  The cake was far from the light fluffy chiffon consistency as I had hoped for.  Maybe rather than sifting 2 3/4 cups of cake flour, he meant to measure 2 3/4 cups of sifted cake flour?  It was definitely denser than a chiffon should be.  I also found his varied title use confusing: guava frosting . . .  guava chiffon topping (in ingreds) - guava chiffon frosting . . . guava topping (in directions) huh?  Back to the drawing board . . . there has to be a good Guava Cake recipe out there somewhere.  My recommendation, be ready to make creative changes to this recipe along the way or you will be disappointed.</td>

There are so many spices that it totally dominates the flavor to the point that you cant even taste the natural taste of the turkey and I added an extra 3/4 of a pound of ground turkey to try to balance it out. Third, when you point this large a quantity of spices in something, it starts to get a gritty dry texture to it, rather than the juicy moist texture you want in a sausage. Also, the ground cloves are out of place in this sausage and make it taste more like a curry. There is also way too much ground clove in this! I&amp;#039;ve had curry dishes that used far less ground clove, so what you end up is a sausage that tastes more like a bad curry. Another thing is the amount of pepper. OMG! Way too much pepper and then it calls for a little cayenne on top of that! I would say if you think you will like the flavor of this sausage, cut all of the spices in half. In my case, I went with something far more simple. Ground ginger, fennel seed, ground sage, salt and pepper is all I needed to make an absolutely delicious butcher quality sausage.</td>

The white or Cajun gumbo from southwest or south-central Louisiana, and the red or Creole gumbo which developed around New Orleans where tomatoes were more readily available. This recipe is neither. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This simply isn%u2019t gumbo.  It is a very bland vegetable chicken soup that leaves anybody trying gumbo for the first time thinking%u2026 it is really strange that all those rednecks down on the Gulf Coast love this stuff so much?

It may be a bit more complex but there is a reason that people have made gumbo this way for 150 years. This concoction as it stands tasted a lot like hospital food. The things that are missing here that remain critical to creation of authentic gumbo are, to name a few: thyme, basil, cayenne pepper and although thickened with okra a little file%u2019 powder would add the final essence of a really tasty gumbo. Deglazing the trinity with a little white wine would also add body and character. Lastly a really thick dark brown roux is a must to carry the complex and wonderful mixture of ingredients in gumbo to the next level.  I gave this recipe a one because it is chicken soup, and I like chicken soup, but unless renamed I would give it a large negative number if they were available for forgeries.</td>

The mess left on the serving platter is not something I would ever want to serve to guests. Presentation would not pass muster at all. I can't speak to the flavor of the recipe - it could be the best tasting thing ever for all I know at this point - but it was messy, dangerous, and downright ugly so I don't think my guests would ever get to taste it. Glad I tested this BEFORE making it for dessert following Christmas dinner. I don't know if letting it cool in the pan for a while first would make a difference but since you pour the caramel all over the bottom of the pan, I would think that it would harden and make it next to impossible to remove. So I would NOT recommend making this!</td>

Although this one was very similar in consistency and appearance, the flavor still tasted wayyyy different than what you get at Popeye's. Even though this recipe calls for a very small amount of vinegar, it overpowered the smell of the gravy. Before making the recipe, I purchased a small container of gravy from Popeye's so that I could compare the two side by side. When you take in the smell of the real Popeye's gravy, you smell the meat and the pepper and the spices. This recipe smelled nothing like the real thing. It is also quite a bit saltier than Popeye's, but that part could be adjusted by using low-sodium broth and either omitting the added salt or adjusting the amount to suit your taste. I am just so disappointed that I spent the money to buy the chicken gizzards and the ground pork and then still didn't turn out a final product that tasted like Popeye's. Oh well, my dog was thrilled to have the leftover meat.</td>

That's a big difference, now I'm not sure what to make. old recipe said two pounds of Cauliflower now you're saying 4 cups which is one medium head. Your old recipe said 2 pounds of Cauliflower which I had to weigh and realized it's going to be two heads as each one weighed just about a pound . And it still wasn't much in the end. Now your new recipe says four cups, which is the equivalent to one head as your recipe says. So it seems like it's less Cauliflower and a lot more cheese. I'm confused about your amount of ingredients on Cauliflower and cheese how can I change so much from one recipe to the other? This is why I'm giving it one because it's very confusing .</td>

When all ingredients are mixed, it's sticky so I cover my palms with butter, roll dough in between palms and pinch off about 2 inches and put onto greased cookie sheet.

I've been baking for 50 years, to much praise and these just didn't cut it.

But I am sorry neither of us liked the rolls at all. The only thing different I did was use 1/2 lb of ground beef and 1/2 lb pork, plus I used the savoy cabbage. First I thought it was a little short on the cooking time but went with it anyways. I had put spare cabbage leaves on top of rolls so they wouldn't burn and then I covered in aluminum foil for about 40 minutes. Then removed the cover and the leaves and basted a couple of times for remaining cooking time. But when we ate them I found the cabbage not quite cooked at the stem ends and there was way too many onions and way too much rice, that it made the rolls very dry with only a taste of those two ingredients. Even with the sauce to dip each bite into , it was just way to dry for us. I don't ever like to waste food but I did not keep all these leftovers. I am so sorry Northern Polar, I have never given a bad review before I don't think. But if you could check just to be sure these are the right amounts of ingredients for the rolls.

Before baking, I brushed the tops with egg wash and sesame seeds.  I was disappointed at how these turned out.  The first problem is that the bagels were not done in the recipe's time range.  I ended up with about 26-1/2 minutes before they were nicely browned.  I was concerned about the 375-degree temperature because my other bagel recipes use 425.  This concern was supported by the fact that the bagels were a little doughy despite the longer baking time.  I made sure to gauge the temperature with an oven thermometer.  If I decide to make these again, I will use the higher temperature.  The is not likely because in addition to the texture problems, the taste was just not good.

In my town is a guy who had made a small fortune in used cars and real estate, and had always wanted a restaurant; so he bought a local eatery and poured money into it to make it a nice place. However, he has a major jones for thyme. He's on his sixth chef and is struggling to develop a following because he insists on infusing thyme into every recipe imaginable; similarly, with awful results. If you love thyme, maybe this recipe is for you. If you love good filet, go elsewhere.</td>

Pat the slices dry and submerge them in melted butter before arranging as scales on the fish. This technique is not easy to pull off. It's hard to get the potatoes to stick to the fish even under the best of conditions.

Some other reviewer had remarked that the mixture seemed really dry, so she drizzled with oil. I took that advice, but it did not help. It was like eating sawdust! There is really nothing in this recipe except Italian seasoned bread crumbs, garlic, and Romano cheese. So where is the moisture? I used pre-grated in store Romano cheese from Meat Farms. It was a bit drier than the Locatelli brand I usually buy. But Romano is not much of a melting cheese, its usually used as a dry spaghetti topping. So where was the &amp;quot;bubbly&amp;quot; . supposed to come from? If this were mozzarella or some other soft cheese the bubbling would come from the melting cheese, but hard grating cheese did not melt. I see one of the reviewers pictures had sliced melted cheese on top, but the recipe did not call for it. I would be willing to try this recipe again, if someone cold explain why I ended up with the dry ingredients as dry as when the went in the oven? One thing I should note is that the mushrooms I used were purchased stemless, so I did not add any.. I doubt adding them would have caused any moist bubbling anyway..</td>

      <td>The size of the pan is the real secret to getting crunchies right. You use the smaller of the two standard sizes, so that the crunchies come out thicker and don't dry out in the oven. \n\nAlso, as a South African, I've always made my crunchies with baking soda. You mix the baking soda into the syrup and marg, so that it bubbles up and you pour that over the dry ingredients. That's what gives the recipe its proper honeycomb flavour. I've never used self-raising flour for any baking.</td>

First off, there has to be less tomato sauce and more bbq sauce or, use ketchup and bbq sauce combined.  Tomato sauce is too bland.  And a shake of garlic powder is completely useless here.  It was rediculously not enough.  I used 95% ground sirloin so there was not the grease factor here, but there was a lot of liquid I spilled out and that is from the tomato sauce.  It was mush, sliced mush.  It was a waste of good ground sirloin.  You have the right idea, but you got steered wrong with the bland tomato sauce.  I think if you use half a cup of ketchup or bbq or a mix of both would improve it immensely.  Also, I would recommend minced onions, dried or fresh.  What a waste of good meat.

You may end up with expensive ingredients wasted.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;I don&amp;#039;t like giving any bad reviews but in this case I have to to get your attention to how much time, food and dishes will be wasted if you follow these directions. The prep is well over 30 minutes. The first direction don&amp;#039;t turn on the stove till told to is a mistake. There are two number 7s and a lot missing. When to add lemon zest and oyster sauce are not noted. The food done exactly as written was raw after 20 minutes. Either she means precook the meat and then steam on low with all this or she is missing steps. We had bought the extensive list of ingredients and was eager to try it but after an hour plus with starving family members and raw food we ended up salvaging the dish by dividing it into 2 batches and stir frying in a wok instead of layering in a skillet pan as directed. (It was hard because there was raw meat touching veggies, veggies that should be cooked longer than the meat.) It wasn&amp;#039;t optimal as all these ingredients have varied cooking times but after the thought of wasting it all we did it. The taste after stir frying was good. The veggies and pineapple with the meat were tasty.  The sauces were interestingly good but not sure when to add the two ingredients above. All in all if you start with a wok and ignore the directions it should work out better. Hopefully the chef changes the directions but until then beware.</td>

We ended up digging a new hole in our front lawn and filling it with charcoal. (The fire department sent us a letter about that)\nAfter finally getting the moose (on the John Deere skewer) over the smoldering coals we realized we were low on fuel (for the tractor). It costs a lot of money in fuel to turn a moose skewer by tractor for 9 straight days! Which, by the way should be noted as an estimate... We calculated (too late): an 800 lb moose @ 10 minutes per pound = 8000 minutes into 60 minutes = 133.33 hours into 24 hours a day = 5.5 days.\nOur moose turned out very dry.\nAnother note: gut and bleed the moose properly. We made the mistake of trying to clean out the entrails by reaching in through the anus. My wife's arms were just not long enough to reach all the way in... Needless to say I had to resort to other means. A spreader, a hoe and a small rake finally worked. BTW, we also forgot to hose the inside down and drain it before cooking.\nWe thought it a good idea at this point to stuff the body cavity with seasonings and vegetables. We placed all of our harvested onions, celery, carrots, and potatoes inside the moose (next time we'll save some in case things do not turn out).\nIn the end we still ate the whole moose as we had placed our winter provisions into this dish and moose season doesn't open again 'til next year.\nWe froze the leftovers.</td>

It's more sweet than spicy. I don't know what made it sweet but I used unsalted butter, regular corn tortillas, and regular half and half. I didn't care for the sweetness at all. You know, it being Poblano soup and all, I was looking for spice. 5. It turned out thick. Like porage. I let it slowly simmer for 7 minutes.

First, I’m no novice baker, but executing the dough as written makes it FAR too crumbly/dry to actually roll into a ball, and I needed to add more egg to make the consistency workable. Second, lifting the cookies from the cookie sheet after baking was impossible—although greased, the jam stuck to the pan, making removing them without crumbling impossible. Literally all the cookies broke apart. Third, while I will never make this recipe again, the combination of flavors was delicous. If this recipe was modified slightly it might be more worthwhile, but I don’t recommend.</td>

Prepare top sirloin cubes. Pound cubes with a meat tenderizer into flat, 1/8-1/4th inch thin flats. In a large frying pan, on medium-high cook the beef until browned on both sides. Remove the beef and set aside. Do not drain the grease. Add butter to double the amount of fat in the pan on Medium-High heat. Add flour slowly until a soft paste is formed. Brown the paste well, completely cooking the flour. A dark brown is fine. Do not let the roux burn. Slowly add warm water to the pan, making a gravy. Put the beef back into the pan, along with the onions. Add Cumin, Paprika, Cayenne and Salt to taste. General rule for salt is 1 Tbsp/lb of beef. General rule for spices is start a a teaspoon, and adjust after the dish is made to taste. Stir well, and add warm water to cover the beef. Turn to medium-low. Cook for 2.5-4 hours, stirring occassionally. Allow to simmer until tender. After 2 hours, put traditional yellow (not fast or quick) grits to the boil, then reduce heat. Add salt (not too much). Follow package instructions, but add water as neccessary. Stir frequently, until a creamy, soft texture (about 45 minutes, longer if you made too much).

      <td>I wasn't going to put any stars on this because I believe that my experience is definitely not the norm and had a lot to do with the way the pork cooked, BUT, I really didn't like it, so 1 star it gets.\r\n\r\nFirst, this recipe has the dubious honor of being the LAST crock pot recipe I ever make because I am so frustrated with my experiences.  I have determined that there really are no "fix it and forget it" recipes.  I bought the ingredients for this one before I read that I had to brown the chops.  Sigh.  I don't have time to brown chops in the morning before I leave for work.  So, I did it the night before and put the browned chops in the fridge. (another dirty dish) Then I put the other ingredients together in another container.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, I layered the chops, then poured on the "sauce".  Based on some of the reviews, I added a couple of shakes of red pepper and 3 small cloves of garlic, pressed.  I put my Proctor Silex crock on low.\r\n\r\nHere's my other gripe about crock pot recipes - none of them can take the 10+ hours of cooking when I am gone.  I leave the house at 7, and, if I'm lucky, DH is back by 5 to turn it off.  Most dishes are indistiguishable shreds by then or completely dried out.\r\n\r\nA couple of the reviews had me scared - they said their chops were cooked by 5 hours.  I asked my mom if she would turn off the crock pot at 3 - leaving 8 hours of cooking.  I figured I would be cooking a little more when I got home to warm them.\r\n\r\nWhen I got home, I looked at the chops - they looked cooked, but none of the sauce ingredients had melded at all.  I mixed it up a bit and put the dry ones on the top in the bottom.  I turned the crock back on high for the ~30 minutes or so that it took to cook the rice.\r\n\r\nMy DH ate the first one, and he noticed it was pink inside.  The texture seemed cooked (not raw), but they were pink near the bone.  The vegetables were still crunchy.  They were not tough or dry, but I definitely had to use a knife to cut them.\r\n\r\nI don't know why 8 hours on low was not enough for these.  I have made country ribs with a bottle of bbq sauce, and they usually have fallen off the bone by the time I get home.  I make a chicken dish, and I have to put the CP on a timer so that it doesn't fall apart, but they are cooked after the 4-5 hours, so I know that my CP is working ok. When I turned it up to high, it was practically boiling (makeing me feel better about not cooking these on high). \r\n\r\nI think it might have been the lack of "juice" because they basically dry-cooked, and it was very inconsistent.  I probably should have used my slow cooker instead of the CP, but I have a difficult time converting the temp gauge to what it would be in my CP.\r\n\r\nSo, as I said, probably a cooking problem, not the recipe, but I did follow it exactly, and I did not have success.</td>

I knew through reading through it, that it was a Mock-Banana Foster ice cream, so I thought that with the buttermilk instead of Half &amp; Half or whipping cream, it was supposed to be a low-cal ice cream. Thankfully, I made two separate batches of bananas: 1st, exactly per the recipe. No matter HOW LOW the heat in a non-stick skillet, the bananas turned to mush and never caramlized. I then tried some in a cast iron skillet and they burnt. So, knowing how to make Banana Foster, I added all the ingredients to turn this recipe around, and then had total success. I am not listing the ingredients because after all this work, I'm posting my version of a tested and working recipe for other's to enjoy. A beginner cook with little experience would have had a costly experience with this recipe.</td>

A coule peices of meat sauteed in oil and garlic and couple cans of Pastene kichen ready tomatoes. Simmer  an hour or two. I am italion and all my aunts and mother do the same. You can't beat it. Believe me I'm trying but it's not working. I did like the sauce but when I mixed it with pasta I did not like it! Also, cottage cheese in lazana I should have known better. My god! I believe I followed it to a t. Never again!  I'll stick to ricotta with a couple of eggs and parsley and lazana noodles at 350 for 30 minutes covered with my own sauce. A layer of noodles then ricotta a little mozzarella and sauce repeated a couple of times. I think one star is to much for this recipe. Sorry!</td>

Way too much water/cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  A much smaller amount would have done the trick.

Instead, they all added less liquid, most needed more flour, some made other substitutions or add-ins.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;These biscuits were just short of horrible.  I followed the directions to the letter and ended up with an extremely wet dough (fine, I'm used to adding more/less flour to adjust for humidity, batch differences etc. but I added well over 1/3 a cup plus liberal amounts on the board).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The rise was not too bad, though with the amount of baking powder one should expect as much. This very same poweder though, led to the next problem I experienced....a pronounced and lingering flavour of baking powder (not pleasant btw).  Add to this a rather assertive level of salt, and we have a basic flop of a recipe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Again, I hate to be so negative, but really, I wasted my time and ingredients -- organic ones at that!  (I know, who cares? I do ... $$ down the drain)&lt;br/&gt;I actually came back to the computer to double-check that I had made the correct recipe and that it was the one with all of the glowing reviews...that is when I noticed that nobody actually made the recipe as it is written, despite thanking you for the recipe...what is up with that? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;So my point is two-fold:&lt;br/&gt;1) for me at least, this recipe as written was not successful&lt;br/&gt;2) if people are going to leave reviews that basically involve substantial changes to the recipe, how can you give the recipe 5 stars? Or am I missing something?  A recipe isn't supposed to be a loose list of ballpark figures and generalities (to be fair this recipe gives exact measurements), esp. in baking. So, when you change things to that degree I don't think you can actually say the you made the recipe in question and as such also can't review it.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Again, sorry for the negative review and the mini rant but I just get frustrated at this kind of thing.</td>

Based on the reviews, I expected this to be great.  I followed the directions exactly and not only was the flavor not all that great, the entire dinner was a bust.  At the end of an hour of bakinbg the top of the chicken was almost burnt and dried out and the bottom was pretty much raw.  This, even after a comment I saw in the reviews I took all my oven racks except the bottom one to even out the heat so that wouldn't happen.  Didn't work.  So I had to cover the top with foil and take out the other dishes I had to go with it and continue baking for almost 50 minutes (and my oven is pretty on target), then had to reheat the other dishes which did not exactly improve them.  And this was only a 2 lb chicken, I could only imagine a 2.5 lb. one.  Nobody was even very impressed by the flavor.  Some found it too spicy and salty, some just found it unimpressive.  I had hoped the steaming would mellow out the flavors and it would all blend together well and it did not.  I'm sorry, I had really expected to like this, and I don't like giving low reviews, but between the disappointing flavor and the disastrous results when I had guests for something as simple as a roast chicken, and the fact that the directions did not come close to realistic, I had to be honest.  Pethaps this type of chicken really does need to be done on a grill where the heat is strongest where the bird is thickest.</td>

I decided to do a redo, but only this time I wasn't going to whisk the cocoa in. Instead, I folded the cocoa into the egg whites after they had been whipped. &lt;br/&gt;After baking them for an hour, I was shocked to discover that my lovely meringue cookies had burnt! This is one recipe that definitely has some kinks that need to be worked out.</td>

I was skeptical about the recipe not including eggs, but with as many great reviews that it recieved, I thought it would be okay to try it.  BUT, I see now what the addition of eggs does for a pudding.  That smoothy, creamy texture and rich flavor was totally lacking in this recipe.  It pretty much tasted like chocolatey cornstarch "glop".  Today, after sitting in the fridge overnight, the texture is almost like gelatin!  Bleh.  I am very disappointed in this recipe and next time I need a chocolate fix, will RUN back to my old recipe.  (BTW- For those afraid of using eggs due to having egg "lumps", a simple run through a strainer before cooking can easily catch those lumps.  The eggs have it!) Sorry. :(  Two thumbs down.</td>

I seasoned the organic chicken breast with Lawry's garlic salt, McCormick's onion salt, McCormick's Garlic Pepper and drum roll... McCormick's Ground Cardamom (a new $10 spice I bought after hearing it so often on cooking shows).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;It HAS to be the cardamom.  I've cooked with the others for YEARS and nothing remotely close to KFC.  Now, I'm curious to find the 11 and try fried chicken.

I have a guac. recipe with similar ingredients but different ratios; mine is a good recipe, but definitely not Chipotle's.  I thought that maybe these ratios would make my recipe better - NO!  I used red onion, and only one serrano (only had one); It was too salty, and there was way too much cilantro &amp; onion.  I love garlic, but it ruined this guac (I'm now convinced garlic does not belong in guac).  After tasting this disaster, I added two more avocados to help dilute the onion, cilantro, salt, etc... - I probably needed to add ten more.

I read every review to see what experience everyone else had with this recipe. Well, let's just say it was a disaster. The sauce did NOT thicken. So I added more cornstarch, and more, then a little more. It did not work. After that the sauce was ruined. It started out the right color,and  the right smell. ( the kind that makes your mouth water ) This is the third ( 3rd ) time I have tried and it was a bust. I dont see how I could possible mess it up, more importantly I don't see how 4 teaspoons of cornstarch would thicken up the sauce, and I don't see that anyone can make this sauce and it turn out like the picture. Maybe someone can tell me what I'm doing wrong or have some suggestions as to why this is happening. I just give up, and will have to just eat it when I go to the mall.

I followed the recipe to a T, and ended up with a crepe-like, totally watery batter, even after letting it sit for 20 mins. to allow ample time for the liquid to absorb.  The finished pancakes ended up as thin as crepes as well, with a completely un-pancake-like texture.  To top it all off, they stuck to my oiled non-stick griddle.  I don't think brand should have much to do with the lack of success, but I should mention that I used Bob's Red Mill rice flour, which works well in other recipes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I don't give up easily, so I decided to do a little experimenting, and embellished another batch. I added 1/2 tsp. vanilla and about 3 tblsp. of Honest Earth creamy mashed potatoes (gluten free, of course - nothing but potatoes, butter, salt), which thickened the batter nicely.  What I ended up with was something rather unique and delightful.  The texture strongly resembled that of traditional pancakes, albeit slightly heavier.  They're a little on the crumbly side, which can be addressed by adding something like guar gum next time.  They also had a lovely, slightly crispy outside.  The batter can stand up well to additions like fruit chunks or chocolate chips, which sometimes sink to the bottom and burn.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Bottom line:  My vanilla and potato embellished recipe was a crowd pleaser, especially with the kids.  We all ate fewer pancakes because they're more filling, which meant that we also consumed far less syrup - always a good thing.</td>

Somewhere between the cooking time, the amount of flour to thicken the peaches, and the cornmeal, things went badly awry. For one thing, &amp;quot;7 cups of sliced peaches&amp;quot; is a terribly inaccurate way to measure sliced peaches. It might work for other fruit, but peaches are too juicy. Also, 45 minutes in my oven wasn&amp;#039;t nearly enough baking time. I gave it an extra 10 minutes and even that wasn&amp;#039;t enough. The top part bubbled and it looked done, but the underneath was soup. Okay, not great but still edible...except for the fact that the yellow cornmeal makes the topping really, REALLY gritty.

In comparing the Relish recipe with this one, I see that there are differences. Specifically, the Relish recipe calls for more butter and sugar (too much, really), and it does not specify the use of finely ground yellow cornmeal, which, in itself, would make a huge difference. I have no idea which of these recipes is the original one from Hell&amp;#039;s Backbone Grill and which is the imposter. Maybe they are both imposters. However, my years of baking experience tell me the recipe printed on this website is closer to the real deal than the Relish recipe with the same name.</td>

      <td>Sazon Goya is mostly MSG and corriander.  MSG gives that good flavor but it makes people very sick. In my opinion, using MSG in a recipe is at best cheating, and at worst a poison.  It may taste good going down since it gives that umami taste,  but it will inflame the heck out of your brain and your vasculature.  It&amp;#039;s like putting transfat in your food, and you know food manufacturers are no longer doing that in large doses because the stuff is terrible for us and they don&amp;#039;t want to admit that it&amp;#039;s in there. Either leave the MSG laden sazon goya out, or find another recipe.  I decided to try the recipe as is, not using the sazon goya, and using MSG free broths and seasonings.  It tasted like chili. The quality of the chili is based on the quality of your chili powder, Gebhardt is fine, it also probably has MSG in it listed as &amp;quot;natural flavorings&amp;quot; so don&amp;#039;t feel obligated to track it down.  As for the dark chili powder be careful what you buy, if it has salt added to it it&amp;#039;s going to make your end product too salty unless you back off on the salt elsewhere.  Dark chili powder is the same thing as regular only the pepper is roasted longer so it&amp;#039;s smokier and often it has spices added in like garlic and cumin etc.   BTW &amp;quot;Texas&amp;quot; Chili  is just a version of Chile Con Carne, a dish that has been popular in the region since the Spanish occupied it, maybe before then, who knows.  It is our state food after all.  Most people only know chili by what they eat at Wendy&amp;#039;s (and actually, their chili isn&amp;#039;t all that bad even if it does have beans, which it really shouldn&amp;#039;t not because the beans are not tasty but because they are not needed and they don&amp;#039;t belong in chile con carne sauce which is what chili is.) There is no thickener used in this recipe, I&amp;#039;m used to my chili being pretty thick as in not at all soupy, as in... the spoon should stand up in the bowl on it&amp;#039;s own. This recipe relies on the 3/4 cup of spices it calls for to thicken the sauce.  I ended up adding water at 1.5 hrs just to keep it from sticking to the bottom.  I stirred in a little corn starch slurry at the end to make up for the extra water I had to add.  This recipe has a two things going for it.  1) The cook time, it takes over two hours of cooking your chili to get the meat really tender and fine textured 2) it&amp;#039;s easy, you just brown meat and stir in spices no sauteing of aromatics to slow you down. This was pretty flavorful chili I have to say, but I could only eat one bowl of it.   I would say this would be great stuff to add to something else in small amounts, like chili nachos, or some other appetizer.  I probably wouldn&amp;#039;t make this and serve it as a main course, I kind of knocks you over the head with flavor and I just thought it was too much, It might be good if the judges are just tasting a tiny bite, but not for feeding a meal to someone.  If I would make this again I think I would stop after the second spice dump.</td>

My eyes watered when I opened the oven to remove the meatloaf. The flavour is so overpowering that I couldnt even remotely taste meatloaf anymore. It was just very sweet and sour. I will not be making this receipe again. If I was going to give advice here, it would be to just top it with BBQ sauce which would give it some acidity and some sweetness without being overpowering. Also to add some herbs and mustard to the meatloaf base to give it more flavour. The sauce totally stole the identity of the meatloaf here. If I wanted to eat something tasting of vinegar, sugar and ketchup, I would just spread that mix onto a slice of bread and not waste a pound and a half of meat which you wont be able to taste once you cooked it with that sauce.

I even started a thread about this recipe, hoping that some chef could simplify it for me and we just threw up our hands! First, there are no directions on how to bake a pork roast, for those that don't know how. Second, it mentions "left over butt roast" and the fact that you "boil it with water, onions and garlic." That would have reduced my already fork-tender pork roast into "pork paste!" When it comes to the sauces, it says to "add all the ingredients". But, if you've never done this before, I had to question "Does that also mean adding the shredded pork that #4 suggests?"  I may actually make the sauce, add the meat to it and see how it turns out.

      <td>I really hate giving bad reviews but this meal was not liked very much by myself or my family. I made it expecting what was in the picture and wound up with some kind of soupy mush of half-boiled/half-mashed potatoes, kielbasa and chopped vegetables. I followed the instructions up until I realized that the water was not going to evaporate. After that, I removed the lid and let it cook for the rest of the time (9 minutes), stirring occasionally to cook all of the potatoes. I wound up ladling out some of the soupy stuff so it would evaporate and I ended up with potatoes that turned (almost) to mush. We also found it pretty bland and we all doused it with ketchup to eat it. I really wish I would have taken a picture of the look that was exchanged between my son and husband when I sat the plates in front of them. The first thing out of my husband's mouth was, "That doesn't look like the picture on the recipe card." And he is completely right. Many people try a recipe based on the picture. I really wish the picture that is posted as the main photo would be taken to illustrate a recipe that isn't altered so much that it winds up looking nothing like the way it is supposed to turn out. Overall, the picture difference was bad but I would have had the same review of this recipe if the picture would have matched whatever I wound up with. I will definitely NOT be making this again. I will also post a picture of what mine looked like since I've seen quite a few reviews describing something similar to what I had.</td>

Also, I assumed the recipe called for fresh rosemary, but I'm thinking not considering how overpowering the rosemary flavor is using the amount called for. This recipe could be fixed, first by omitting the majority of the tomato sauce and swapping in broth or water. Second, by reducing greatly the amount of rosemary.</td>

Whoever posted this recipe in the beginning needs to go the the Czeck Bakery in West, TX if they want to see what a real kolach is supposed to look and taste like. Oh well, maybe they'll taste better warmed up in the morning.</td>

For those who DO like the recipe, maybe you can use this tip to your advantage:  There was a lot of the liquid in the crockpot when done so I put in about a cup of instant rice and let it soak up the juices for about 10 minutes.  It would have been great if I was able to get past the sweet &amp; vinegary taste.  My fault perhaps, because I much prefer savory to sweet.  I will not be making this again. :(</td>

In addition, the batch that I made came out a little too sweet, too garlicy, and not spicy enough. The flavors were not to my taste. If anyone else tries it, I would suggest lowering the amount of brown sugar (since the 7-Up in already sweet, too) and using less garlic (I only used 2 tablespoons and that was too much). I used black pepper, but cayenne would have been a better choice. Better luck next time.</td>

I poured off the cream that was floating on top into a 2 cup meauring cup and then added enough half and half to make 2 cups.  I took the clump of cheese that was left and cut that into small pieces.  next I made a Roux by melting 1/4 of butter and then adding 1/4 cup of flour whisking constantly until it no longer had a "floury" taste.  I added a little half and half to incorporate and then added the rest of the half and half, whisking constantly.   Once the mixture began to thicken, I mixed in the chilies, 1 teaspoon of cumin (which I will leave out in the future) and a few dashes of hot sauce.  I turned off the heat (this is important do not do the next step with the heat on) and added the chopped cheese from the mess I had before and continued to whisk until it was incorporated.

I have tried to bake this banana cake for more than 10 times, only the first few times in the beginning came out good and very delicious. The rest came out very dense, from bottom to the half of the cake. Everytime i baked for longer than 1 hr 1/2. I don't know what have i done differently between the good and the bad result. Do you know what have i probably done wrong? I have read from some websites that the speed of the mixer should not be higher than medium. I have tried that but still the cake was very dense. If you believe that the speed is the cause, could you please also tell me which speed and how long of the mixing of each process should be. Or shouldn't i use the mixer? I have read that some increased the temparature of the oven. i actually already tried that but outside of the cake became drier than the cake from the suggested temperature.

Unfortunately my local supermarket only supplied a 1x1 ratio Stevia mixed with Dextrose product for Sugar Replacement so I had to add half a cup rather then half a teaspoon. Despite this, I don&amp;#039;t think this could have made too much difference to how the recipe ought to turn out. All I can say is the final product was something which didn&amp;#039;t know wether it was a cake or a casserole. So basically an unusually dense, savory, eggy carrot cake, or a sugary Quiche. It was embarrassing for me since this was the first time I baked for this family member of mine, who I had previously told I was good at baking. Proceed with caution!

      <td>Update: These were great when I made them, but the next day they were dry and the glaze soaked in them. I had to throw them away. So if you make them, eat them the same day. I'm going to look for another recipe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This is the exact same recipe I received with my mini electric doughnut maker. A few tips I learned: using my mini doughnut maker they baked in 2 minutes. Any more time than that and they are tough. The recipe made about 43 minis. The icing I made was: 1 cup powdered sugar (sifted for lumps), 2 tablespoons of hot water and 1/2 teaspoon pure almond extract. If using pure vanilla and/or pure almond extracts, I start out with less and add more if I need to. I tinted half with one drop of red food coloring to make pink and the other half I left plain. This was a perfect amount of glaze/icing for this recipe. Only dip about 4 doughnuts and then add the sprinkles. Otherwise the icing hardens and the sprinkles fall off. I found out the hard way. :) I did add 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon. They turned out very pretty. Oh, if you are using an electric mini doughnut maker, use about 1 teaspoon of batter. When you close the lid, they will turn into doughnuts. I just used a chop stick to remake the hole in the center. Easier than trying to miss the middle. LOL</td>

      <td>Wow. What a disappointment! I'm not much of a cook, so I always follow recipes EXACTLY and this time was no exception. The first problem I had was with "flattening" the batter. Mine was almost the consistency of cooked oatmeal (couldn't have spooned it onto the baking sheet - would've hade to POUR it). So I added a little more oatmeal to give it some heft, but they still spread out pretty much once placed on the foil. Then when I did try to flatten it as directed, the spatula simply stuck to the batter and lifted it up. I tried spraying the spatula with non-stick spray, but this only worked for the first one or two cookies, then it would start again, so I gave up on trying to shape them. I followed baking time as stated, but after 7 minutes, then 9 minutes, then 11 minutes, I still had no "golden brown" edges, so I inreased the temp a little. I cooked the next 3 batches for 11 minutes at the higher temperature. Removing from the foil was a joke. The center of every cookie stuck. Fortunately, this part of the cookie was hidden by the filling. Once I had all the cookies assembled, I had way too much chocolate sauce left over.  This could've easily been cut in half!  All this said, it would've been ok if they'd tasted good, but they didn't. I didn't think the cookies were sweet enough and the chocolate filling was bitter. I had 4 boys and one girl in the house (ages 15-19) and only one of them even finished the first cookie! Definitely not a keeper in my recipe book!</td>

More like 45. I recommend adding them 20-30 minutes BEFORE all the other vegetables. If the recipe is fixed I will delete this review and try it again. By the way, what exactly is a &amp;quot;bite size&amp;quot; chunk of an onion? And please tell us what kind of lentils to use?</td>

You need to melt the butter (oleo), marshmallows, sugar, evaporated milk and salt into a thick buttery looking syrup.

Then you remove from the heat and add the cherry chips and mix until melted and blended. Spread in a 9x13 pan and chill until set.

I had my doubts about the ratio of ingredients listed here, but I precisely stuck to it anyways to see how it would turn out; I was right to doubt it.  Calls for way too much baking powder and soda, and xanthan gum.  I used to make that mistake when I first started gf baking, and things usually turned out gummy.  Quick bread recipes should have approximately 1.5 to 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon or less of baking soda, and 3/4 teaspoon xanthan  per 1 cup of flour/starch.  Adjusting close to that ratio should bring the gummy texture down to the desired flaky texture without too much crumbling, but another binding agent such as an egg or egg whites would then be needed.  Oh well, onto my next experimental recipe!</td>

I think, however that if you take the time to read the package directions on the rice and not the recipe and remember to make it 2 pts. O.J. to 1 pt. water I think that this would be really good.  I do intend to try this again and will try to write a 2nd review based on this revision. BTW I have never had to completely throw out a recipe, but do realize that it was because I was in a hurry and did not cross reference the package directions with the recipe directions on the  liquid quantities even when it did not seem right to me, I consider that this flop was mostly my fault.</td>

      <td>I made these with a 12 slot muffin tin. The biggest problem was this recipe calls for WAY too much oil. 3 Tablespoons of olive oil is far too much. They came out soaking in oil, and that after two tablespoons of oil was added to sautee the onions. So the main thing is to cut down heavily on the oil content - just the oil used to sautee the onions is plenty - so adding even more at the end is unnecessary. Also, equal measures of salt &amp;amp; pepper is another problem. Most professional recipes call for 1/2 of pepper use to any salt. A teaspoon of salt here is too much, so a teaspoon of pepper is WAY too much. You can do with a half teaspoon of salt and a 1/4 teaspoon of pepper. \n\nThis recipe has potential, but needs a lot of rethinking. They do need refrigeration to solidify. Agree with another poster here that these come out runny, wet and soft because there&amp;#039;s no gluten to bind the cheeses together. We used 12 oz. of whole milk ricotta - which is creamy, not crumbly (this recipe says to break ricotta crumbles???). For the other 4 oz. we used a goat cheese - and it added a great depth of flavor. We also used rosemary and not parsley - which made it even more flavorful. But the way this is written, they surely do NOT turn out as they do in this photo. The picture here looks to have a serious amount of breading, or bread crumbs, in it to bind it that way.</td>

I still had to drench them with syrup which I really do not like because it is really unhealthy for you. Seriously. Turn back!</td>

These deviled eggs are simply average in overall profile, I followed this recipe exactly down to every 1/8 teaspoon\n2. This recipe calls for too much salt\n3. there is no explanation of what constitutes the &amp;quot;salad dressing&amp;quot; that could potentially replace the mayonnaise.  Is it Italian, Ranch, French?  Who knows?\n4. Most importantly; A good deviled egg is mustard-forward without the mustard overpowering any of the other ingredients.  I had to quintuple the mustard to even taste it.  Which, then, overpowered the green onions which i double to provide some balance.\n5. In closing, this is not the ultimate final deviled eggs recipe that it claims to be and has been reported and rated as such.\n\nSuggested alternations; half the salt, 4-5x the mustard, add more of the green onions, dill, pepper, and paprika to taste (apx. 1/8 -1/4 teaspoon of each).  Also, you must thoroughly beat or whip the yolks and mixture to get the velvety/creamy texture you expect from a caterer/restaurant quality deviled egg, for the record.</td>

The biggest issue with creating your own saline solution is knowing the correct chemical balance that won't burn the inside of your nose, and I don't think that this recipe avoids this issue. I used this recipe and changed the amounts of kosher salts on several occasions, but each time, my nose burned as if I snorted glass. That's when I found a product on Facebook called Nav&amp;auml;ge Nasal Care. It's like the neti pot, but WAY better because you get these SaltPods that have been pre-measured to balance the water requirement. It was funky to try, but when I did try it, my nose did not burn!

Mushrooms, when cooked, have tons of glutamic acid.  So does soy protein, which is why many people cannot have soy sauce if they react to MSG. If you take a peek at the ingredients in the &amp;#039;all natural&amp;#039; soup base used for this recipe, two ingredients stand out.  One is soy (aha!) and the other is celery.  Both of these ingredients are often used in the food production industry to create glutamates.  Glutamic acid gives savory foods that lovely umami flavor; but they can produce reactions in people who are sensitive to them that range from headaches and hot flashes to heart palpitations.</td>

While I'm glad I gave it a try, I've got to to be honest and say it's not really for us. All we could taste was the Worcestershire and the cayenne (which sent me into a sneezing fit during dinner) and the hot sauce, no hint of the earthy mushroom flavor we love. We live in New Mexico and eat lots of chiles and spicy dishes; I like some Worcestershire and a sprinkle of chile flakes for some heat, but this was over the top. I also cut the sauce ingredients in half, because I was afraid that would be the case, and it was still too assertive for us. If you are concerned about the amount of Worcestershire and heat, you may want to seek out another recipe or cut the ingredients even more drastically than I did. A little goes a very long way. Keep the garlic, though!</td>

I normally love Tyler&amp;#039;s recipes, but this one leaves out a couple of important points and therefor was a total flop for me. Most importantly, the sausage must be fresh, UNCOOKED sausage. Maybe he talks about this in his commentary, but I didn&amp;#039;t have time to read that. We have chicken-apple sausage in virtually every store in the San Francisco bay area, but they are all pre-cooked like the Aidell&amp;#039;s brand. If you buy that without knowing, you will have one heck of a time removing the non-existant casing (should have been my clue to stop, but I went on anyway.) You can&amp;#039;t break up the sausage and make a meatball out of it. I ran the whole mess through a food processor...still no luck. The meatball mix was one big mess and a total waste of time and money. Second, if you actually put the smashed garlic in at the point he suggests and then continue to cook the onion/carrot/celery combo for 5 mins, you will end up with totally burned garlic. With the combo of burned garlic and meatballs that were a bust, I ended up just making the tortellini and putting jarred sauce over it. By the time I made it through the disasters above, the family was starving and I had no option. I admit I am not the best cook so maybe this whole thing is my fault. Believe me, that is not surprising. I have been wrong so many times in my life and certainly this will be far from the last :))  But just thought I had to put this out there in case there are other stupid people like me. Looks like the other reviewers knew what to do. Truly, I applaud them for their skills/knowledge. I wish I had it too. But, alas :))</td>

The apple juice burns off leaving sugar to burn on your ribs.  This method ruined a family dinner twice.  Should have learned the first time.  If you want great ribs you need to marinate the ribs overnight in apple juice.  Then put your favorite rub on and let sit for several hours.  Set our smoker to 160-165 F for 2-2.5 hours.  Then crank up to 225 F until ribs are cooked.  30 minutes prior to being done baste the ribs in barbecue sauce and mop after the first 2 hours with 60% apple cider vinegar and 40% olive oil every 45 minutes.

And only 8 oz. of soda to prevent a super thin batter, the consistency of pancake batter should be that of a good gravy, thinner would be good for crepes.

But using grams and following the specified weight to volume indication on the respective packages of the two flours, the recipe translates into approximately 1/2 cup each of the two flours for a total of 1 cup of flour. 1 pkg of cream cheese, 3 tbsp of butter and 2 eggs are not nearly enough moisture for 1 cup of flour to create a batter.

The weird thing is that it says you can put the biscuits on top of the mixture and bake until the biscuits are golden brown.  That only took 15 minutes although at the top of the recipe it said bake 40.  Did not make sence.  I took it out as the biscuits would have been burnt.  When I took it out, the outside of the biscuits were done but the inside of the biscuits were gross and not even close to being baked.  If I would have put it in for another 1/2 hr the biscuits would have burnt.  I instead put it in the microwave at 5 min at 1/2 power.  That made the biscuits perfect, but the hamburger, cream cheese, cream of chicken and ketchup was just nasty.  Take a chance, but have another alternative ready incase you don't like it!

But it was nearly dinnertime and the ingredients were in the cupboard so I tried it. So, if you get home late from work and the kids are hungry, give this a try, it&amp;#039;s quick and easy. It just might be to your taste, it just wasn&amp;#039;t to our taste. Be sure to rinse the black beans, they&amp;#039;re pretty salty. (I did that, so that&amp;#039;s not why we didn&amp;#039;t like it). Just out of curiosity, I re-heated the leftovers in the microwave a couple of days later to see if the cornbread topping became soggy. Surprise! It turned out pretty well. So your leftovers will be ok. Then I threw out the remainder.</td>

There are two problems, the tapioca and the dough.\r\n\r\nThe tapioca doesn't melt or disintegrate during cooking, so you are left with the little white Tapioca balls throughout the filling which just doesn't look appetizing. But more importantly, the dough is just too...doughy.  It ends up turning into a cake like topping that overpowers the filling. If you turn it over and put it on a plate so the filling is on top, you'll see that it looks more like a "shortcake" type recipe, a la strawberry shortcake.  The peaches really bake into the dough which is fine, but not very much like a southern peach cobbler.  The dough/topping should be much thinner so as not to over power the fillings, but not so thin as to be more like a pie crust.  It should be someplace between the two.  This is not it.

I will say that I probably did something wrong (although I'm not sure what it was.) Maybe I should have let the dough chill longer or my butter should have been softer, but the cookies fell to pieces...to the point that it is almost impossible to eat them. They tast good.....what pieces I can crumble together, but for me, if I am going to spend this much time in preparation and eat this many calories, then it needs to hold together so I can really enjoy it. Once again, sorry for the bad review, if you have any advice to what I did wrong, I'm definitely open to hearing it so that I can learn.</td>

I've now attempted to make it 3 times in about 4 hours and each time its just not working. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, but the mix is so wet and even if I add flour it stays completely soaked and doesn't keep its shape. This is just such a high rated recipe that I believed it would be okay to try but sadly I was mistaken. I'll have to find something else to go and make for my German class party.</td>

      <td>I'm sorry Stacy that I wasn't able to give this recipe more than 1 star. While this soup is quick 'n easy to put together, it somehow lacked flavor. I found this soup really needed some added spice. To make it more flavorable and to thicken it up, so I added the following ingredients...one (14.75 ounce) can of cream corn, 1 stalk of celery (thinly sliced) 1 cup thinly sliced baby carrots, 1/2 tsp white pepper, 1/2 tsp garlic powder (but next time I'm going to add at least 3/4 tsp). I did add 9 cups of cubed potatoes (cut 3/4-inch in size) and I cooked this on HIGH for 5 hours in a 6-quart slow-cooker, and when it came to adding the cream cheese, I added 12 ounces (Yes I said 12 ounces) as I thought a bit more cream chesse would of thickened up the soup, but it did not, so then I added (8 ounces) of shredded sharp cheddar cheese, plus I added all the cooked bacon to the crock. One more thing I should add here...in order to get the cream cheese to blend into the soup better, I took as much of the broth as I could get, (along with the cream cheese) and blended it together in a blender. Then I poured it into a large saucepan, added the shredded cheese, and cooked it until the cheese had melted together, then I added it and the cooked crumbled bacon to the crock-pot, and made sure all was heated thru before serving. After adding the extra ingredients, I found this soup had a lot more flavor, and it thickened up nicely, and I then found this soup to be a 5 star recipe. Stacy I am glad to see others here enjoyed this recipe. We did too, but only after I had doctored it up to our liking.</td>

I used pre-shredded cheese. Prepackaged shredded cheese comes coated with a non-stick-to-itself coating that may of made the mix too dry. ( I added 5 more eggs to moisten the mix~ maybe I should have used milk?) Also , I read a review that said, &amp;quot;When using a gas oven~ reduce the temperature  by 15 degrees&amp;quot;. I cooked it 45 minutes trying to get a darker melt on the cheese.  By that time the the crescent roll base had turn dark brown. Should I have not cooked in in a pyrex dish?&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;   I used free-range eggs, Pillsbury Crescent rolls, Harris Teeter cheese, Jimmy Dean pork sausage , all good ingredients...yet the dish lacked flavor.

I followed the recipe to the letter and found to my dismay that the dough was dry and crumbly, essentially a bowl of sand. I've read that diamonds are formed under 725,000 pounds of pressure per square inch; that's how it felt trying to press this dough together. Rolling it was another agony, as it cracked instantly and deeply on the first roll. Cracks everywhere. It was impossible to work. For cookies I typically roll and cut and reroll as many times as I can to use as much dough as possible, but after making several attempts to do so with this dough I no longer had any remorse in throwing out the leftover scraps. By the end I didn't even bother flouring the surface I was rolling it out on, the rolling pin, or the dough. This stuff wouldn't stick to anything, let alone itself. I'm no stranger to dough, and this was a nightmare. The cookies themselves turned out just as badly. The dough lacked the intense fragrance one expects in gingerbread dough, and after baking they were similarly bland. They taste like cardboard. They taste like...vaguely cinnamon-flavored cardboard. They are dry and difficult to chew. A disappointing and unappetizing experience. I suggest finding another recipe.</td>

I'd read the reviews and thought it sounded good. This was one step above horrible and, after languishing in the refrigerator for two weeks, was thrown away. The cheese mixture before the seasonings were added was not offensive, just bland and ordinary. However, once you added the seasonings, it became harsh, bitter and chalky. Even many hours chilling in the refrigerator did not mellow the flavor. In a vain attempt to salvage the spread, I added more pineapple to counteract the seasonings, then attempted to thin and dilute it with more pureed cottage cheese, and then milk. Alas, at the end of the day, it just wasn't worth the calories (even if they are reduced in number!). On the upside, I do think the cheese mixture has potential as a base for a healthier spread. Some combination of fresh, chopped herbs  and scallions would add fresh, vivid flavor, while avoiding that overly processed tang from the seasoning mixes. Also, thinning the spread slightly with lemon juice, milk or some other fluid would greatly enhance the texture. I don't mean to sound harsh; obviously, there are many people who loved it, just not me. :)</td>

The first time I make something I like to stick to the original recipe, adaptations can come later. I wish I had tweaked this one though, and listened to my instincts that the bay leaves just didn't fit in with the rest of the flavors. I pulled them out altogether when I removed the ham bone to strip it of the meat. By then the damage had already been done. The soup had a very pungent, bitter flavor with strong floral tones from the bay leaves and we just could not eat it. I threw the whole thing away. I am someone who uses bay leaf in several go-to recipes so I am not unfamiliar with it's flavor. If you must use it, I would caution you to use one small leaf at the most.</td>

The texture was very nice and light and wonderful but I feel the recipe fell short with taste. It just was blahsville with a slightly baking soda taste. I used all the specified ingredients but made a half recipe. I typically do this to test a recipe for the 1st time. I am glad that I did as it just didn&amp;#039;t do it for me. I did make some mini-muffins with small muffin wrappers which is a nice way to enjoy a bite of a duffin. I&amp;#039;ll experiment with some other duffin recipes to see if I can find one that is more tasty. I took the mini-duffins out of the wrapper and tossed them into a bag with the cinnamon sugar mixture to hopefully coat them with a little more flavor. That helped a bit.</td>

First, I followed the directions to a T., and as written, but how does one cook onions until tender in butter, over high heat without the butter AND onions burning? I anticipated this happening so I added olive oil to the butter. There was no way I could then sear the scallops in this until golden. As it was, the onions became very dark, just short of burning completely.  The flour, cheese and salt mix ratio to milk was way off and made the wine sauce waaay too thick. I had to add at least another 1/2 to 1 cup of wine to the pan, and continue to cook, but didn&amp;#039;t want to reduce too much.  After having to make all of these adjustments, the end flavor was bland, but acceptable, but only after I added some red pepper flakes and Old Bay seasoning.

Furthermore, lemon zest when cooked goes very bitter, so I&amp;#039;m not a fan of that either.\n2. Is it one or two garlic cloves?\n3. This is my preference, but two shallots is better than one - the sweetness balances that acidity from the wine.\n4. Too much butter. This needs 25g tops or it is too greasy.\n\nAll in all, a poor reclipe. Better to stick with a classic meuniere; wine, shallots, garlic and parsley. The lemon ruins it!</td>

      <td>Ummm, the way it came out for me had me rereading the recipe over and over again to see where I must have made a mistake, but other than using limes, I didn't make a mistake, and this was a big disappointment.  It was as green as guacamole (I'm guessing because of the limes it turned greener), the pics make it look more white.  But color isnt my disappointment, but taste.  I Greatly like cilantro, and couldnt taste it even a little bit.  It tasted like sour cream and lime juice.  Seriously.  As if I ate a spoonful of sourcream with lime juice sqeezed on top.  That's it.  I then began adding all types of spices/ingredients to make a new creation.  Some mayo, cumin, light brown sugar, pepper, steak seasoning, I mean I was comin up with all kinds of ideas of how to change this into something other than sourcream with lime juice, and it took a Lot of the above ingredients to even change the taste!  That's the reason for the 1 star.  Is it possible the lime over the lemon made That much of a difference???  I guess I'll only know by making it again with lemon juice.  If that ever happens, I'll be sure to post the results!  Maybe it was my expectations.  I was expecting wayyy less lime flavor, more cilantro, and creaminess, not just the taste of sour cream. Have a blessed day in The Lord JESUS nonetheless!! :)</td>

Unfortunately, I was greatly disappointed, and I sincerely advise anyone who is thinking of making this cake to reconsider.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Yesterday, I whipped up a microwave mug cake, and it had a cardboard-y flavor, and inconsistent, generally tough texture.  I wanted to try again, thinking maybe just the recipe I found happened to be bad.  I have definitely learned my lesson after trying this recipe today.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The lesson:  Don't waste ingredients on microwave cakes. They are terrible unless you like the sugary, nasty, can't-quite-identify-what's-wrong-with-it taste of stale Cosmic Brownies.  That's the closest thing I can compare this cake to.  It's the kind of thing you'd expect to get in an individually wrapped package and feel sick after you eat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I followed the recipe, and it was almost inedible.  But I was a trooper and managed to make it through one piece with the equally as inedible sauce on top.  I threw the rest away after I realized how hard the cake became after sitting around for only 10 minutes.  I should not be able to drop a piece of cake from four feet up, listen to it thud, and have it all STAY PERFECTLY INTACT.  I was in shock and disbelief, so I tried it again and again, only to see the same result with the same piece.  I cringe when I think of how this dessert must be congealing as it goes through my digestive system.</td>

My bread machine is brand new and it has never had that smell before and hasn't had it since but it was really bad with this recipe. It seemed like there was just way too much flour and so it couldn't mix it as easily (both bread machines had the same problem). When the dough was ready to be taken out, it was not fluffy and did not rise well. I know it was not a problem with the yeast because I used it afterwards with a different cinnamon roll recipe (http://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/bread-machine-cinnamon-buns-50722) which turned out perfectly!!!!

I have a good electric mixer, an accurate oven, etc. I wanted to use up 6 eggs, so I Googled &amp;quot;sponge cake recipe&amp;quot; and found this one. The photo at the top of the page shows a traditional sponge cake, tall, with a hole in the center. But the recipe calls for 2 9&amp;quot; pans. Since there were so many rave reviews for the recipe, I decided to try it, as written. The only change I made was to add about 1/2 tsp. of vanilla to the egg yolk mixture. \n\nI took the pans out of the oven after 24 min (instead of 30) because I could tell they were done. In fact, they were overdone. The cake is like an actual sponge--not like a sponge cake. It is tough and rubbery. I suppose if I douse it with some liquid or sauce, it could become edible, but a store-bought, frozen pound cake can be improved just as easily.</td>

I took a couple of extra steps to try to bring this to life as I was already a bit weary up front, but I also felt silly questioning numerous 5 star reviews. I haven't found any recipe where canned mushrooms work better than fresh mushrooms, so I substituted fresh mushrooms which turned out well. I also butterflied the chicken to help the flavor penetrate throughout the breast. In the end, the chicken was cooked to perfection as far as temperature was concerned, but the overall flavor was really overpowering, and not in a great way (this coming from someone who typically enjoys pungents foods). I supposed making your own pesto would make things a lot better, but that would also defeat the purpose of a simple meal wouldn't it?

There are too many variables left open in the recipe, I think. The title of the recipe is "Hot Chocolate Cake" yet the ingredients state to use prepared hot cocoa - hot chocolate and hot cocoa are two different things. All I had at the time was instant hot chocolate mix so that's what I used. And that too leaves a lot of variables to consider - marshmallows or plain, should it be made with water, or milk, or a bit of both water and milk? I used mix with marshmallows as that was all I had, and prepared it with just water. I baked this up in two 8-inch round pans as upon pouring the batter into one pan it was nearly full; I expected the cake to rise a good bit and so got out my second pan for half the batter. The cake did not rise much at all. It also stuck to the pans; I think greased and floured pans would have been better than lightly greased pans. Will not be making this recipe again; what's left of the cake (which is all but a couple bites) is going in the trash.</td>

Ham is already very salty, so my fault for adding more salt to it(like in the soy sauce) If you are an avid salt lover, maybe the soy sauce would be for you.

I used yellow onions since I don't know what brown onions are.  Overall I'm really annoyed to be throwing out a huge batch of soup after crying over the onions!</td>

I have cooked slow cooker polenta before, and used a different recipe which required 6 to 8 hours to cook, on Low, 3-4 Hours on High.  I had my doubts about the &amp;quot;Basic Polenta&amp;quot; recipe when I read that it took only 2 1/2 - 3 hours to cook.  I&amp;#039;m not a happy camper.  It is 8 p.m. No polenta.  P.S. - I found the other recipe.  It calls for BOILING liquid, 6 Cups to 2 Cups of cornmeal, slow cook on Low for 6 -8 Hours, on High for 3-4 Hours.  I added another 1/2 C. of cornmeal to the already cooking, now boiling hot, polenta mixture in my slow cooker and stirred it in well.  The mixture had already been cooking on High for 4 Hours and was still relatively soupy.  Hopefully, adding additional cornmeal will correct the recipe enough to produce a decent polenta in another hour or two.  &amp;quot;Basic Polenta&amp;quot; recipe needs to be corrected.</td>

But I've been on a quest to find the perfect CC cookie recipe. This is not it. These cookies are soft yes, but that's the only thing they have going for them. They are more like a cake than what I would call a cookie. I hate cakey chocolate chip cookies. They have far too much sugar, both brown and white. One cup of each would suffice, and what most recipes call for. But I didn't change a thing about these, made them exactly how the recipe states. After they came out of the oven, I gave them a hard tap on the stove top to help flatten them a little while they cooled. After they cooled, I put them in a container with a lid, with wax paper between the layers. Went to get a cookie last night and they're soggy. I mean soggy, like I dropped them in water. These are by far the worst CC cookies I've ever made. Even my husband who loves CC cookies, refused to eat them.</td>

      <td>Unfortunately, after shredding, freezing for only a week or so, thawing, and cooking this chicken, the result tasted terrible. I tried it in two recipes. The first one tasted so bad (freezer burned, maybe?) that neither myself nor my husband could finish our meal. The second time I used it I tried drowning it in Buffalo sauce, which made it at least edible for me, but my husband gagged when he tasted it. I am wondering if some of the positive reviews were written by people who had not tried it after freezing and thawing. The texture was dry, but I was somewhat expecting that when I made it. The flavor is what I object to. The only thing I can think of to compare it to is the taste of Thanksgiving turkey after it has been in the refrigerator for several days. I know it was not the chicken's fault, because it was purchased at the store just the day before, not past date, and I grilled some of the very same batch of raw chicken, diced it, and froze it, and it tasted fine after it was thawed and reheated. I am not sure if the problem was with the method of cooking it in a crock pot, or if cooked shredded chicken should just not be frozen. I suspect the latter, because I think I tasted a bite before freezing it and it tasted fine. I only wish I hadn't made 10 quart bags of the stuff. :( Tweaks: I used boneless skinless breasts, and instead of adding seasonings and using plain water I used some already-seasoned brine for the liquid. Also, I cooked it on high for the first hour or so before switching to low.</td>

Water takes away flavor. Steaming would be better for top of stove cooking and steam has about twice heat content (faster, more penetrating) of boiling water and much less dilution so they cook quicker. I preferto broil or grill because I think its more flavorful. Joytosew is smart to save the broth, Just shows you how much flavor was lost from boiling the tails.

      <td>Sorry.....but this recipe basically bombed for me and I&amp;#039;ve been a low carb cook for several decades.  In my opinion, these are the reasons it was a flop:  1.  need to precook the broccoli.  So, after I spent quite a bit of time making this, once it was in everyone&amp;#039;s bowl (three men &amp;amp; myself) they all noticed right away the broccoli was hard as a brick.  I then had to fish out all the broccoli and put it in the microwave.....this caused the chicken to become overcooked and kind of hard.  2.  This dish needs more veggies (so next time I try it, I&amp;#039;ll add garlic, onions, mushrooms &amp;amp; perhaps some celery 3.  It was very runny.....more like a soup so I wouldn&amp;#039;t call this a casserole....so a thickening agent is needed.  4. Though the sauce wasn&amp;#039;t bad, to me it was very bland so we ended up adding Frank&amp;#039;s Red Hot sauce...so I was kind of &amp;quot;Buffalo Chicken Soup.&amp;quot;  6.  Putting the bacon and chicken in the refrigerator was totally unnecessary and a waste of time.  7.  I&amp;#039;d add another cheese next time with the provolone because I think this was the reason it tasted bland.  8.  You don&amp;#039;t need to cook the chicken until it&amp;#039;s no longer pink since it&amp;#039;s going in the microwave for 30 minutes.  In short, and not to be mean, but this whole &amp;quot;casserole&amp;quot; needs to be reworked.</td>

He starts by melting Lard, then sauteeing dried guajillo chili peppers, onions, tomato paste, cumin and garlic, and then dry chicken base/bouillon.After the onions have softened,  He adds the contents of the skillet to a pot and adds water. He allows this to simmer to develop the flavors. Then he adds a little lemon and hot sauce.  He removes the chiles and adds chopped cilantro. Per serving he adds tortilla strips, avocado and cheese. He specifically states that there is NO CHICKEN in his recipe. So, there you have it. The author says he got the recipe from El Fenix; so i guess he got ripped off.</td>

I made these yesterday and despite following the recipe the nth degree, they came out awful. Wanting to know what it was I did wrong, I began looking at numerous other recipes and finally realized why. There appear to a number of details left out of the recipe. For one thing, the her directions of the making of the dough itself is confusing. She tells you to mix the yeast with warm water (no temperature) and sugar and allow the yeast to bloom. In the next instruction she tells you to add the flour, 1 cup at at time to the yeast mixture, oil and salt. Sorry back up there, for in her list of of much of how much of this and that, does even tell you you need salt in the first place. As such, I had to guess and my scant 1/2 tps of salt was, by far and way, not enough. Nor was I aware that you had to let the bagels dry before baking them. As a first time bagel maker, I had no idea this was necessary. And because I had taken several missteps in the making of these bagels, they took 20 minutes to bake, not 10. This recipe has the potential to be a very good one, but if you're a first time bagel maker, as I was, I'd not recommend the recipe for there are too many critical details left out.</td>

I have done this for many years with excellent results so I doubt that was a problem. Other than that I followed the recipe to the point of timing the Kitchen Aid mixer to the times given in the recipe. The batter looked marvelous but things took a downturn during baking. It started fine but at about 25 mins the top began to crack badly in a circular pattern around the whole pan. I did a toothpick test to see if it was nearly baked already. The interior was still pretty much thickened batter so the baking continued. The toothpicks never did come out clean and I called it quits between 55-60 mins.  When the cake was removed from the pan it's sides had fallen in in several places making it un-level  and the interior was more fudge like than cake like. The cracks in the top remained deep and I chose to not bother with the ganache as I knew that I wouldn't be serving it. My sincere apologies but I won't be trying this recipe again.</td>

I was suspicious of a recipe that did not include any eggs or milk, but thought I'd give it a try, and followed the recipe. By the time the batter was ready to go into the oven I was already wishing I had stuck to what I knew; the batter was incredibly thick and unlike anything I'd made before. The mixture did not rise at all in the oven or even flatten out; each cake is completely the same shapes as the dollop of batter that went into the oven. Also, all the cupcake cases are totally soaked in butter. I ended up cooking the cupcakes for about 45 minutes to see if they could be salvaged, but the tops just ended up burning while the insides have a stodgy, over-moist, greasy texture. I don't like leaving negative reviews but I was really disappointed by this recipe, and signed up so hopefully someone else won't have the same experience.</td>

Initially, batter was way too thick - almost doughy, so I checked the reviews to see if anyone else had noted it and realized I should start reading reviews before I start cooking!  Since it hadn't gone into the oven yet, I added about 1/4 cup of vegetable spread, and 1/4 cup of liquid (I used eggnog, since many reviews said it needed something).  That batch didn't rise and came out looking like dense mini cornbread, but the flavor was pretty good from the 'nog.  I added 1/2 cup of milk and eggnog to the batter so that the batter was more loose, like a cake batter.  I thought it didn't leaven properly the first time, so I added 1 tsp of baking soda as well.  Viola!  I have the most amazing, delicious, fluffy eggnog cupcakes ever!

I'm no expert however I've been baking for enough years to just know when things are not quite right with a recipe, but I'm of a mind to follow recipes as written the first time i make them regardless. The dough was easy to work with albeit a bit sticky. It was quite sweet though, for my taste, and I really feel these need a second rise to get the proper texture. They were a bit too dense, which I think a second rise would fix. 10 minutes was not long enough to bake them - I had to bake them for about 35 minutes before they were no longer doughy in the middle. And the icing... wow. Too buttery, and also far too much for the how many rolls you have to cover. I think less butter and more cream cheese would be better, and only about a half recipe from what's written otherwise it's just too much icing and it's overpowering. I would not make this recipe again without some major changes to it.</td>

      <td>So disappointing, but a good starting point. This recipe is on Mimi's Cafe Website, btw, so they put it out there, and I suspect it's intentionally &amp;quot;off.&amp;quot; First off, all I taste is baking soda. Two teaspoons of baking soda seems like a LOT. Most muffin recipes of similar volume call for 1/2 to 1 teaspoon. I'm not sure why this one calls for two. I'll use 1 tsp on my next try. They are also dense and dry. I'll be reducing the flour by 1/4-1/2 cup. Bland. Not enough sugar, not enough spice, needs some salt too! And vanilla. Only calls for nutmug and cinnamon...and double nutmeg than cinnamon. Needs cloves and maybe allspice. The topping ratio of nuts to sugar seems off and it all just falls off. This time I'll press the walnut pieces into the tops, and then sprinkle on the sugar/spice mix. And I'll try moving to the top rack the last few minutes to attempt to caramelize the sugar a bit and make the nuts more toasty.</td>

      <td>I had never made these before and I decided to give it a try. I did not have any pie scraps, all I had was one Pillsberry piecrust left over from when I made a quiche. It had already expired (only a few weeks though) and I wanted to use it but didn&amp;#039;t want to make a pie, so I found this recipe and decided to give it a try. My mom told me before hand that they usually don&amp;#039;t taste good but I decided to try anyway. Unfortunately, she was right. We didn&amp;#039;t like it at all. I don&amp;#039;t know if maybe it was the pie crust we used but we just didn&amp;#039;t like it. I cut the pie crust in half and then worked with each half and made a tray. I used the scraps from that to make a third tray. The first time I cooked a tray I set it at 20 minutes. It just looked a little brown to me so when I made the second one I cooked it for 15 minutes. That came out better. The third pan, which was the scraps, I cooked for 12 minutes and those turned out the best. I&amp;#039;m happy I tried it but I don&amp;#039;t think I&amp;#039;ll be making it again. I guess the saying &amp;quot;mother knows best&amp;quot; it true.</td>

I made it exactly as written. I gave it only 1 star because it wasn't sweet or dill just bland. I have 2 wonderful recipes; 1 for sweet zucchini and 1 for red pepper and onion and felt with this dill relish I would have relishes perfect for anything and everything. I wasted a lot of time and ingredients. Maybe it would have tasted better if I had followed tweaks the reviewers used to get those stars. I'm glad others had such wonderful results but this recipe is definitely not for me.

Burnt almond cakes should be light and airy...sweet, but you shouldn&amp;#039;t be able to tell the sweetness is coming from honey, powdered sugar...or whatever, its subtle.

The volume of ingredients overwhelmed the wok, and it did not cook properly.  In addition, the marinade does NOT turn into a teriyaki sauce when cooked.  The result was dry and flavorless beef in thin liquid.  If you dare to make this recipe, only make half of it.  It may cook better, and there won't be SO much of it.

The Dough doesn't have enough liquid to measure out and each time comes out more of a pie crust consistency and impossible to "roll out". By the time the ingredients come together and the liquid absorbed, you have a crumble consistency and after sitting for 4 hours will not "rise" at all. Once pressing the dough (pie crust style) into a 9" cake pan, there is only enough to fill the bottom if you use the entire amount. Next-the pastry cream also has too little liquid. The step to "Return mixture to the saucepan, reheat to a gentle boil" is impossible as the consistency after 2 tries is of a cookie dough (can't boil that). I'm certain of my measurements and just can't see this working. Sorry Twissis, but this recipe simply didn't turn out.\r\n~Buddha</td>

I laughed a little when I read the part of the recipe that said to put the vegetables in a ziploc bag, coat them with oil, put them in the pan then put the roast on top of them without ever saying to take the vegetables out of the bag. Funny to me, but I could see some people thinking that it might work like the turkey bags that don&amp;#039;t melt in the oven.

I also added about 1/4 cup more sherry, a couple of chicken bullion cubes, some onion powder  and a cup of boiling water.  It became edible, but I won't make this again.</td>

Now, I wish I had listened to the negative review. I wanted to like this recipe. I really did. I read through all of the comments and tweaked the recipe (added green peppers and made extra sauce) because I was so confident that I'd have a great dish to eat over and over again. Instead, I have a ton of food (I batch cook and freeze meals) to throw away. While this recipe had a nice variety of vegetables and seasonings, it had next to no flavor. I cannot believe how bland it is. I can usually tolerate under seasoned recipes well enough to finish them. After all, I put time and money into the dish. Not this time. I am throwing it all in the trash. It is that bad. I hate posting negative reviews because I have found some wonderful recipes online.

The flavor was pretty good even my usually meat-eating husband liked the flavor, but the texture was horrible. It was like eating a rissoto put inside bread. So I thought maybe the oven would work better, dry them out maybe. And the next day I cooked the remaining four in the oven for a long long time. They just wouldn't get firm. I eventually forgot they were in there and they did get firm, just too firm! They were like rock solid. I did taste one and they probably would've been good if they were cooked maybe half an hour less. I don't know why these did not work for me? I did think maybe it was because i accidentally bought barley flour instead of just barley. Could that be it?

I boiled my fresh broccoli and feel that steaming would of been a better choice for appearance and texture. Secondly, the cooking of the chicken....if my memory serves me right the chicken is thinly slice chicken and has a light breading of sorts on it. In the directions it suggested chopping it up after being cooked and tossed with everything else :(.The selling points for me and this dish has always been the orrcheta pasta and lightly breaded chicken. This had neither of them. :( I do not recommend this recipe if you are looking for a copycat recipe.</td>

And I didn't like it because most of the dry ingredients were listed in the form of ounces rather than cups; so, I had to weigh all those ingredients on a food scale. (Is that the way Canadian people cook, or should I have not weighed anything? Maybe that is why it was so dry because I weighed the ingredients instead of measuring them in cups. I know my English measures, of course.) I think I'll look for a new recipe because this one would be very difficult to improve. If I were to try this recipe again, I would not weigh the ingredients, or use maple extract. I would use more maple syrup. I don't like to leave negative comments, but please know I do not have a bad attitude, and I do not mean to sound rude or insulting in any way.

I used two 9&amp;quot; pans. They ran over. It was a &amp;quot;volcano&amp;quot; in the even. What batter that had not set was placed in a pan with cupcake liners. Got 12 cupcakes from this mess &amp;amp; had to scrape the oven &amp;amp; pans. What a mess. I thought all 9&amp;quot; pans were standard. Guess not. Cake 2- decided to do some cupcakes in addition to a 2-layer cake. Cupcakes sunk in the middle drastically! I googled this as to why and possibly I got too much air in the batter. I was tired and chose to beat the final ingredients versus fold. Must make a huge difference. Lesson well learned, that's why I am sharing. Next, the cupcakes severely stuck to the liners. Crumble as you attempt to remove liner. Maybe, I should have sprayed the liners. I am certain it's my fault with this recipe. The crumbled cupcakes taste great. Now, out of the same batter as the cupcakes, the 2-layer cakes looked great. Pulled away beautifully from their 9&amp;quot; pans. Getting dark on top, checked a few times to pull out a clean toothpick. Finally, thought they were done. After letting them cool, I removed them from the pan. Pretty raw in the middle. Am throwing in the towel. Will go to my no fail site: &amp;quot;Add a pinch&amp;quot;. I have made their cakes numerous times. They turn out perfectly. Had to share my luck.

The recipe doesn't tell you to put the egg wash on at the end, and I have a feeling it's supposed to be "unsalted" butter, too.  The best recipe I've tried put only half the butter on on the first roll out, and then the other half on the second roll out and fold over. I realize now that that's the best way to do it.

I don't know quite what it is that I hate about it, but whether I follow the recipe strictly or try so very hard to put more food in  an attempt to save the poor soup, it smells and tastes awful. I am so sorry I made this, I know many other people had a lot of success, but next time I will need to try a different kind of cabbage soup with sausage and potatoes. Hopefully that will have a better taste.</td>

      <td>I had some frozen berries that we picked last summer, that I wanted to use up so I looked for a no-bake pie and decided to try this one. I had no cooked pudding but had instant pudding to use up so I made it exactly as directed on the package with 2 cups of milk. Then I added the jello and it mixed nicely, no grainy taste at all.\n       However, it tasted awful. The flavor of vanilla pudding with jello powder is not good.I had to do something as it was all made, so I put it in a graham shell and into the fridge it went. It did not set, so I put it in the freezer and it is staying there until I decide what to do with it. It will be "sliceable" frozen and maybe with some cool whip it may be edible.\n    The use of instant pudding  instead of cooked would make no difference in the end result.\n    But if you want to try it with cooked pudding ...... maybe one will like it, sorry but no one liked the pudding mix here in this home.Thankyou for the post though...</td>

I followed the recipe - I did not include nuts or chocolate chips - but everything else I did the same. All I can say is that we didn't care for them, perhaps it was the shortening that we disliked in these cookies, the texture wasn't for us... they had a light crunch when you bit into them, but the insides were heavy, dry and hard to swallow.  I was surprised because when I tasted the dough, it was really quite tasty, especially with the addition of coffee granules. I guess maybe we were expecting something else when we thought of 'decadent' and were just disappointed by the end result. I think if you are used to shortening in your cookies, then maybe they would be for you (although 13yo DS, who is not a picky eater, only ate one so they weren't for him either) - I know we won't be doing these again.

      <td>There are about 8 things wrong with this recipe, I’ll name the three most important things. First, soaking your wood chips will do nothing. It will create the kind of smoke you don’t want. Second, do not set your smoker to a temp of 180-200, you cannot cook the brisket to the right temp. That brings up the absolute most important point. Your brisket needs to be cooked to an internal temp of at least 195 and as high as 205. That temp is only a reference point though. The brisket should be pulled when you push a toothpick or instant read thermometer into the meat and it has the resistance of room temp butter. Brisket is filled with connective tissue that won’t break down at those suggested temps. Every decent bbqer will tell you to cook the brisket at 225-maybe 300. But at those lower temps your cook will take a very long time. The flavor of the rub is debatable, but the smoking recipe isn’t. Please find any other recipe online.

Does that mean to bring it up to a simmer first then start the 10 mins, or put it on medium low for 10 mins? And does &amp;quot;hot&amp;quot; mean boiling or 150 degrees? Also, what is &amp;quot;thickens slightly&amp;quot; supposed to mean? Good recipes are _specific_ (e.g. &amp;quot;cook until mixture is hot (about 10 mins on medium heat&amp;quot;)</td>

I have baked dozens of pound cakes because that's what my family likes best, but this was the worst! I knew enough to not put 2 teaspoons of salt in it! That would have been really bad, so I put in a pinch. As for what went wrong with this cake, I have no idea what so ever! It was a great waist of 6 eggs, butter, sugar and flour to say the least! It turned out with a thick Chewy rubbery crust a thick rubbery inside and a half done center, with no flavor! Believe me, I'm never using this recipe again! Sorry to all, but this is what happened and how I felt about it! If you've had great luck with this...that's great!</td>

I notice everyone saying that they&amp;#039;ve been home canning this recipe for years in a water bath with no problem.  I know I certqinly grew up eating home-canned antipasto.  And indeed, the odds of botulism developing in the jars is extremely remote.  But the then, the odds of being in a serious car accident are fairly remote but we wear our seatbelts nonetheless.  Botulism is not just a bit of food poisoning.  Fatalities occur and in most cases, it can take up to a year to recuperate from the ventricular and nerve damage it causes (&amp;quot;Botox&amp;quot; is based on microscopic amounts of the botulism bacteria which is what causes the nerves to freeze and minimize wrinkles).  &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;There is simply NO amount of boiling and sterilizing that can completely protect low-acid and protein-based foods from developing botulism.  Botulism spores can be latent in low-acid foods (esp fish) and don&amp;#039;t present any risk when eaten normally.  However, in prolonged exposure to the anaerobic environment of a sealed jar, they can bloom.  Only sustained heating at a constant temperature of 120 degrees Celcius (at sea level) will kill latent botulism spores.  And since water boils at only 100 degrees, it can&amp;#039;t successfully kill them.  The high PSI in the pressure cooker causes the temperature to rise to the minimum 120 degrees required and is therefore, the only safe way to 100 percent protect everyone when canning low-acid foods.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Botulism is exceptionally rare and I&amp;#039;m sure we could all go on eating antipasto canned in a water bath as we&amp;#039;ve done for years and there&amp;#039;d be no problem.  But to contract botulism could be fatal to the elderly or vey young so there is some serious--albeit low--risk involved..  &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;quot;We&amp;#039;ve always done it this way and never had a problem&amp;quot;  can certainly be a true and valid statement.  But I just think if people choose to can low-acid foods in a water bath, they&amp;#039;re consciously accepting the small risk and doing so with scientific, rather than anecdotal information as to the absolute safety of certain types of home canning.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;But on to a bit of good news: there are no large pieces of tuna in the recipe and they are mixed in with mostly other high-acid foods.  Also, smaller jars significantly reduce the canning time so if you use jelly jars (6-8 ounces) and follow the pressure canning guidelines for something slightly similar (like gumbo or red clam chowder) you should find it comes out really nice.  If the vegetables go in raw, it&amp;#039;s been my experience that after pressure canning, everything keeps its texture, takes on a lovely rich flavour and doesn&amp;#039;t get mushy at ALL!!  So we can be 100 percent safe and still enjoy our divine homemade antipasto!!</td>

Nothing at all like frosting ... would be great on fresh cornbread but on a cake? No way!!  I thought maybe it was just me, not being used to Italian Buttercream frosting. I had my husband taste it.

But I had cored cupcakes for filling so he grabbed a little core of red velvet cake and put a little frosting on it. &amp;quot;Weird&amp;quot;, he said. &amp;quot;That stuff is not for cake. Maybe a corn muffin, but not for cake.&amp;quot; Then my daughter came home. I didn&amp;#039;t tell her what it was for and after tasting it, she asked why I was making so much &amp;quot;honey butter.&amp;quot; This recipe is simple and only a few ingredients, so we know it is what it is, Sweetened butter. I&amp;#039;m not sure what the point of the whipped egg whites was. Those disintegrated with the slow streaming of the sugar syrup and later seem to serve the sole purpose of helping the frosting separate. At the suggestion family to &amp;quot;do something to try to turn it into frosting and not waste all of that butter&amp;quot; I added a two pound bag of powdered sugar and it then tasted like frosting but way too thin to put on a cupcake. It would slide right off. Not being willing to waste any more groceries on this recipe, it&amp;#039;s going into the trash bin as soon as I finish with this review. My advice? If you want a great substitute for honey butter for corn muffins or as something to brush over a fresh loaf of bread that comes out of the oven, this is good. Otherwise, don&amp;#039;t expect anything like frosting. Expect, as you can see from the list of ingredients, to get sweet whipped butter.</td>

Even my SO's brother, who dropped by the house on a whim and grabbed a small chunk of meat that had come off of a chop stopped after that piece, and it's a shock to ever see him restrain himself when there's meat on the dinner table.  This is a guy who typically clears every available piece of meat on the table before dinner is over.  Everyone ended up gobbling up and praising the Recipe #114556 on end and more or less ignoring the main dish - and here in Norway, meat is always the main deal.  That was a strange sight to behold.</td>

The gravy was lumpy b/c of the flour and it was very bland.  \r\nCooking the meat on high in the crockpot didn't make them tender and we actually didn't end up eating most of it b/c it was too touch.  Slow cookers should be used on low for a long period of time in my experience.  Sorry, this is not a keeper.</td>

I followed the recipe with the following exceptions: marinated the chicken overnight in the egg/milk mixture and I let the chicken sit with the flour coating for about an hour to help make it stick better.  I do have a pressure fryer.  The flavors of the batter are wrong - not salty enough, not sweet enough, and there are flavors/spices that are missing.  I also made some nuggets for my toddler - so the difference in texture of the coating was even more noticeably different.   As far as being a "copycat" recipe - NO WAY!  As far a being a decent chicken coating - no way as well - I have better recipes than this.  I would not recommend this recipe to anyone.  However, if anyone does want to try this, I do have one recommendation - just halving the chicken breast results in too big of a piece - I would quarter the chicken breast and pound it flat prior to coating so that it would fit better in the bun.</td>

But as others who have rated this low have mentioned, these turn very bland for my family.  My kids are pretty open minded eaters, but these were even too bland for them.  They convinced our babysitter to let them drizzle syrup over them so there was some flavor, and that was the only way they got eaten.  Now, as someone else mentioned, I have a couple dozen boring, bland muffins that aren't going to help me beat the  morning craziness at our home.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The comment at the end of the recipe says, "if you like spicy foods, add green chilies."  Well, my children don't tolerate spicy foods very well, so I decided to make the recipe "as is."  "As is" my children will not eat them, and I only choked 2 down to try to encourage them.  The texture isn't impressive, and there is no flavor.  I hate to throw food away, but it's going to take a lot of syrup from my kids to choke these down.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I suppose if you added a good amount of garlic, pepper, possibly onion and salt, these might have a decent flavor.

(Luckily I keep a round silpat in my microwave so cleanup was not as bad as it could have been.)  I would add that users should keep an eye on the sauce during the last cooking stage in order to avoid a similar outcome.\n\nGuess it's back to Smuckers or Hershey's storebought for me - which I really hate because I love to make things at home and I really wanted to love this as my new go-to hot fudge recipe, but I just didn't.</td>

Their consistency and flavor is as if they had been made with corn meal and they are not sweet. I had to make some substitutions, and perhaps that contributed to the problem. We are not allwed milk or eggs, so I subbed a banana for the egg and coconut milk beverage for the milk. We even added chocolate chips to make them sweeter, but it did not help.

It really just tasted like shredded chicken with cream cheese and corn (the bean flavor is completely lost), which wasn't very appealing.  At the end of the day, this was a mediocre chip dip for us.

But I changed the recipe and gave it a low review, and it doesn't count? I'll give you that maybe the stickiness was my fault, because the chicken wasn't frozen (I thought the soup would compensate) but I am not the only one to complain about it being bland. In fact, some reviewers suggest adding pepper flakes, Tabasco, garlic, butter etc. and LESS cream cheese. Exactly my point! Adding soup (with more flavour than plain beans) has nothing to do with it being bland, or tasting like too much cream cheese.</td>

      <td>This recipe is horrible and I wouldn't waste my time. At 500F with nothing to keep the chicken moist, you're going to dry out the breasts before they even cook through. You're going to burn the garlic (even the garlic in the picture is burnt) and probably even burn the sugar, too. If you're desperate for brown sugar and garlic flavored chicken, which sounds silly IMHO, coat the chicken in (uncooked   minced) garlic, olive oil, butter, and salt pepper. Don't heat it up, just mix together. Put breasts on a rack over a pan that contains onion, celery, and carrot. Put in an oven at 350F, cook until internal temperature is at 165. On a pan, make caramel out of brown sugar, and add a cup of chicken stock once the sugar is caramelized. Skim off fat, then deglaze pan with a touch of white wine, and put the fond into the pan with the stock and sugar. Add a tablespoon of butter to the pan. Boil and reduce until thick and creamy, then coat the chicken with the sauce. Now you have a chicken that has great caramelized brown sugar flavor, great garlic flavor, and the chicken isn't dry. One last thing: I didn't try this recipe. I've been cooking long enough to know what a bad recipe is just by looking at it, and I wouldn't waste my time and my money even trying this out.</td>

Per my oldest daughter's suggestion, we're saving the cookies for Santa, hoping he'll eat them. ;)   A cookie recipe shouldn't focus mainly on making the dough easy to work with; you also have to pay attention to the TASTE of the cookie.  What's the point in having a pretty cookie if no one wants to eat it?  Also, when the instructions to use 1-2 tablespoons of milk when starting to make the icing, is ridiculous.  Yes, we'll "likely" need more, meaning it's impossible to mix it without a lot more milk.  I was happy with how the icing hardened, but even that didn't taste very good.  My normally icing-loving kids wouldn't go near this icing.  Overall, not very pleased with this recipe and I would not go so far as to say it's the best recipe ever, taste-wise.

      <td>The recipe says to mix in the baking powder, yet baking powder is not in the ingredient list.  It also calls for enough boiling water to drown the peaches and make a huge, mushy mess.  You need about 1/10 that much.  I used only 4T of boiling water.  I also made a crumb topping, as the first step in the process, by mixing in the Cuisinart with the metal blade:  1/2 c sugar, 1/3 c flour, 1/2 t cinnamon and 1/4 c butter.  Set the topping aside while making everything else per instructions (with the exception of less water).  Once you've laid down the batter and poured the peaches on top of it (I mixed in some blueberries to give it added zing), then spread the crumbs out on top and bake for the specified time.  It will be scrumptious.</td>

I followed the directions but omitted the brown sugar (acceptable per the instructions) because I was making a savory dish (Tomato Pie).  I pre-baked for 5 minutes and tested the edge.  I suspected it probably wouldn't hold together as it was so crumbly, almost powdery, but I wanted to follow it through.  Poked holes in the bottom, made the pie and baked for about 30 minutes.  I tested the edge again with the same results.  Let the pie cool for almost an hour before we cut it and ate.  It totally disintegrated in to a powdery mess in the pie.  Thankfully, it didn't alter the flavor of the dish.  This recipe may work best for sweet dishes with the addition of the brown sugar or other sweetener to melt/carmelize and help hold it together.  Even though it didn't work for me, like I said, it didn't actually ruin the overall flavor of my dish so no harm done.  Just wish I could give it better marks but thanks for sharing!</td>

Many internet recipes have done this for this recipe and ruin the texture of this mouse. The techniques on this recipe are way off. It felt wrong, so I went back and checked Julia?s work on youtube and found many errors!&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;According to Julia, you FIRST MAKE SUGAR SYRUP! then add that to the beaten then warmed yolks. If you follow this recipe (like I did with my last eggs, so I could not re-do it) you get GRANUALAR sugar/yolk, = granular mousse, yuck! &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Julia used coffee to melt the sugar and liquor to melt the chocolate, no need to add liquor in other stages like this recipe calls for, ends up with stranger textures and unnecessary steps. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;1)The sugar is melted in strong hot coffee. 2)Beat the yolks. 3)Slowly add the hot coffee melted sugar solution while still beating the yolks. 4)You do thicken (&amp;amp; cook the yolks) in a hot water bath, but you do not cool it on ice, use an electric mix, beat to ribbon consistency (NOT mayonnaise) at room temp, until the egg/coffee/sugar is also at room temp.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Chocolate is a fussy product to use. The chocolate in a liquor, covered,  in a hot water bath, easily melts the chocolate. DO NOT use the double boiler mentioned in this recipe, Julia?s way is both easy and flawless! There is a reason why Julia specifically tell us how to melt the chocolate this way, if it is not right, start over again.&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Do NOT add sugar to egg whites, this is NOT whipped cream, Julia does not do this either! After foaming has started add a smidge of salt and the cream of tartar, then increase the speed to get it to the soft peak stage. &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br/&amp;gt;Cooking &amp;amp; baking is not just the recipes, it is the techniques! Techniques and recipes (correct ratios!), made with simple ingredients, equal great food. Please, go to youtube, watch Julia, then make your mousse!  Don?t be a fool, like me, and trust internet recipes. If any Julia video is around to view, see it first!</td>

The first problem was the dough being a sticky goop; all ingredients were measured correctly and combined well, but it was just impossible to kneed at that state. I ended up having to work an extra quarter to a half cup of flour while the 'dough' stuck to everything and tore apart. Even with the extra flour, rolling onto an ungreased baking sheet was impossible. Initially it tore and shredded and thinned out, once re-kneeded it managed to keep form halfway through before it got too sticky to work with a g a i n... A third try and I managed to get something out of it, but it wasn't nearly the 12&amp;quot; round circle the recipe says, i barely had room for my toppings. Finally after baking the darn thing, even though i had no empty space, 100% topped with cheese, the edges of the dough were a CHIP, the center was nearly gooey, and a darn task to remove from the pan. How this got 5 stars beats me, either I'm unlucky or someone's correction made this a lot more terrible than before. Kevin D.

Third, shredded chicken, when added to the cream, makes this an unappealing mess, not to mention the fact that shredded meat is simply the wrong texture for this dish. I added twice the cream (used fat free half-n-half) as 2 cups wasn't nearly enough to go with the chicken. Added oregano, basil onion powder, garlic powder, more salt and pepper, just to make this palatable. When finished, the flavors were good but the texture was really off--would recommend grilling the chicken then dicing/cubing it instead.

This temp is way to high - it would burn the garlic in the 8 minutes it said to cook.  So adjusted temp - fine.  Then it said to just add chorizo with liquids - what about browning the chorizo?  I ditched that part and browned the chorizo - great.  I then added all liquids/spices then angel hair - looked pretty good until it took it out of the oven after 15 minutes or so of cooking time (as recipe indicated).  The "casserole" was not bubbly at all, it was dry and crackly - the pasta was sticking together in clumps and there was no sauce - arggg!  I suppose I might try it again or use another recipe.  I don't think baking it is necessary and seems to eliminate the sauce - which I love!</td>

      <td>I tried this last year with concord grapes I was given from a friend's yard. I made several batches of grape jelly &amp;amp; had POUNDS of grapes leftover. this seemed a much simpler way than boiling the grapes up and straining, etc. I don't have a steam extractor... but man, what a disappointment. vaguely grape flavored, slightly bitter water. and this is 10 months later! I have several gallons of this downstairs and i think i'll be just pouring it all out and giving the grapes to the chickens - if they'll even eat them. If you drink Welsh's or any similar concord grape juice, THIS IS NOT IT. I wanted to do it with no sweetner, since we never buy grape juice that has added sweetener. I did some jars with none, some with a couple tablespoons of organic cane sugar, and some with a couple tablespoons of maple sugar. all quart jars. my nephews tasted it once &amp;amp; won't touch the stuff. i don't even want to drink it myself. it's not horrible, but it's certainly just not good. maybe if I did it and fully filled/stuffed the jars with grapes first, then just added water around them it would come out...but basically this is like grapes steeped for tea, not juice at all. what a waste of space on my canning shelves!</td>

I had to use double the amount of flour just so I could handle it and it still stuck horribly to my countertop.  I managed to get it rolled out and put all the ingredients ontop, but when I went to roll it up the warm apples had already softened the dough so much that the entire thing was glued to my countertop.

While in the middle of preping and frying the tomatoes, I did dredged the tomatoes in an egg/buttermilk mixture first, before coating the tomatoes in the flour/ranch mixture, to improve the texture, plus I also sprinkled some black pepper on both sides of the tomatoes. I thought the ranch dressing mix would give these fried tomatoes a good flavor, but in the end it did not, so to make these a bit more flavorable, I topped the fried tomatoes with a bit of bottled ranch dressing, which made these taste a lot better. One more thing, I would not recommend using tomatoes that are slight pink, as they just end up getting mushy. Nyteglori, I'm sorry I wasn't able to give this recipe a better review.</td>

By the time the toothpick came out clean, the oven was up to 375 and the cake had been in the oven for well over an hour.

      <td>I **REALLY REALLY** wanted to love these but this is the worst preparation of eggs that I've ever tasted. I had read the other posts complaining about "hard boiled" so i watched them carefully in the oven. The problem is, the eggs seemed to cook from bottom-up, so the whites were runny up til the end of cooking, so it doesn't appear there is any way to avoid the hard-boiled-type yolk. In the end, the whole egg was tough. The flavor was good, and presentation delightful, but I really like my eggs tender. I will be trying these again, covering with foil to see if this allows for less cooking time and a more tender egg. I may also try scrambled, as then the state of the yolk doesn't matter. I'll also cover with foil so the oven doesn't dry it out, and experiment with cooking time. By the way, I did precook my bacon--I just KNEW that my particular bacon would not work without precooking. If I can get any variation to  work, I will update my rating, but as for now, this is basically the worst egg-breakfast I've had in a long, long time.</td>

I was so disappointed because I was hungry and wasted a cup of flour, and there was no time to make another. I browsed other internet sites and found out that other bannock recipes call for only 1 teaspoon of baking powder and the sugar is optional. I enjoyed this recipe when I was a kid but did not remember the ingredients. I'm looking forward to trying this again when I have the time, using much less baking powder and possibly omitting the sugar. Hoping for better results next time.</td>

This dish is very spicy (one-dimensionally so, from the black pepper). The sauce is quite runny, and the suggested rice is essential. It should probably be a formal ingredient. Even better, add it to the casserole and cook just long enough for the rice to cook. I served this (with a slotted spoon) with Recipe #162873 and boxed au gratin potatoes.</td>

      <td>&amp;quot;Line the bottom of an 8x8 baking pan (or use a 9x13 pan if gooey centers bother you) &amp;quot;. Um. No. If you intend on making this recipe with an 18 ounce boxed brownie mix, you'd better use a 9x13, or else &amp;quot;gooey center is not what you'll end up with-- you'll just end up with raw brownie batter. And, if you try to cook it longer, as the author of this recipe mentions, you'll overcook the cookie layer. (Now that I think about it, I'm really not sure that the premade cookie roll would work in a 9x13 pan if you try to follow the recipe in that manner.). Maybe it's better with homemade ingredients, but the fact is, a 9x13 and an 8x8 pan can not and do not cook the same recipe the same way unless you alter the baking conditions, namely the temperature and/or the time. I knew this going in, but chose to use an 8x8 pan because the wording suggested that it was how the author bakes this. Prior to making these, I naturally tried to view the reviews from my phone for tips/feedback, but I wasn't able to see them on safari, and assumed that the reviews left were without text/tips, and were given as stars only. Only after this recipe was an enormous failure in two individual batches did I go to my computer to see what I may have missed. I am so glad I wasn't making these for a function in the same day, or I'd have been completely out of luck. Bottom line: Using an 8x8 pan as stated in this recipe will not result in a fully baked, serve-able dessert. If you're brave, follow this recipe but try a 9x13 pan. However, if you're smart, find another recipe for a similar dish and go with that, because this one did not go well.</td>

The sesame added nothing flavor-wise, and should have been a little toasted first to give it some color. The sauce was also way off. Much too much ginger, which gave it a very strong, bitter taste. Luckily, I started off with less ginger, so it wasn't totally ruined. Also, the ginger would have been better finely chopped, not in long pieces - too much intensity in the mouth at once. And even though I added less  ginger, it still was overpowering, so I increased the orange juice and added some lemon juice. I also used less red pepper flakes. In the end, the sauce was good with my tweaks, but the fish was tasteless.\n\nAlso, the cooking time was way off. Trout fillets take about 5 minutes, not a total of 10-16, as the recipe indicates.\n\nI've made trout so many times, I've lost count, and it has always turned out well.

The meat was rather bland, the sauce was runny, the green peppers were soggy, and all I could taste was the heat from Rotel Tomatoes. I think more cornstarch should be added, to thicken up the sauce. I did use 2-(1 lb.) venison tenderloins, which worked really well in this recipe, but my husband wasn't too pleased, as he'd prefer I keep the tenderloins to make his favorite sandwich, a fried venison &amp; onion sandwich. Guess I should of used cubed venison stew meat instead. Even tho I could not give this recipe more stars and a good review, I am however pleased to see others have enjoyed this dish.</td>

And while this recipe uses a lot of vegetables, it also uses way too much butter and cheese. The topping was also not good, as the bread crumbs cooked slower then the cheese and I ended up with crumbly loose bread crumbs and very crispy cheese. I do not recommend this one, and I really can't think of much to improve it. Maybe a different seasoning combination in the sauce, and adding the cheese to the sauce/pasta mixture instead of the topping would be better? Using at least 1/2 the bread crumbs might also help...</td>

We found this recipe and figured we'd give it a go.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, Ms. Lee's model of cooker must not have shut off after 12 hours into cooking (fortunately, we caught that).  So, if you try this recipe, be sure you are around to keep an eye on it, or you may have an extremely unpleasant surprise.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;After 25 hours of cooking, the 3.5lb roast we used was still somewhat tough.  I put it in a 300F oven in a covered baking dish with some of the liquid halfway up for an additional 30 minutes, which made it tender like a pot roast should be.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Next, the flavors just didn't come together.  The garlic kind of overwhelmed it (even though I am a huge garlic lover, it was a bit much for a pot roast).  And, the celery pretty much cooked out of existence, leaving just the potatoes, carrots and surviving onion and garlic...rather skimpy veggies for a pot roast.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;One good thing:  The amount of cooking liquid is way more than needed, but I am freezing the extra to use as beef stock for other recipes.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Unfortunately, I have to say this just isn't a keeper.  My grandmother's tried-and-true oven pot roast recipe that I have made for the last 40  years takes just 3-4 hours from prep to table (or 8 hours for the slow cooker version), and friends beg me to make enough so they can take some home after.</td>

Put the squash face up on a baking sheet and put in oven. Meanwhile I steamed the broccoli. Then when the squash was done I emptied the contents onto a dish and blended the squash until creamy smooth. Then added everything into a casserole dish and baked! I actually blended a half cup of rinsed cashews in a little water just covering the nuts, for some protein and to make it more creamy! It wasn&amp;#039;t a bad recipe if you like squash.

After putting the cake in the oven, I mixed the frosting and then tasted it because it was considerably lighter than my usual recipe. It was completely devoid of flavor. I then doubled the cocoa (really good cocoa, btw)- still nothing. I added espresso powder- nope. Still tasted like colored powdered sugar. After nearly 1 1/2 c. of cocoa it was mildly chocolate flavored- and super, super sweet nothing like the rich, fudgy frosting I was anticipating. The marshmallows did not melt in spite of being put on the cake immediately after removing it from the oven. And last, the cake. It is dense, that's literally the only thing that this recipe gets right. However, instead of being moist, it has a weird crumbly- almost flaky quality. Of the hundreds of cakes I've made in my lifetime (and I'm no spring chicken) I have never made anything so utterly disappointing before. I wish I had taken a closer look at the recipe as the ingredients are quite unbalanced, but I was in a hurry and was unfortunately swayed by the 5* rating. My 14 year old says, &amp;quot;it lives up to it's name, Mud.&amp;quot; My 16 year old says, &amp;quot;it tastes like a cake from a box, except without the flavor.&amp;quot; This one is going in the trash because no one wants to eat it. Bleh! I wish I could offer a tweak, but this recipe is so far off that the only suggestion I can possibly make is to start somewhere else. :(</td>

If you have a sweet tooth, this is definitely the recipe for you.

I cringed pouring the dark beer and coffee into my perfectly seasoned meat... the flavor is awful. I ended up pouring a whole bottle of chili powder into it just to be able to get it down and not let it all go to waste. Will never make again. If you don't like dark beer or coffee (or even if you do) stay AWAY from this recipe!</td>

The number of stars is based on the cooking method. I wanted this to work, but once again, the slow cooker failed me (I rarely use it for anything other than soup since everything seems to overcook). I cooked the fig/sugar mixture as directed with the lid on and temperature set to low. Then i removed the lid and continued cooking for 3 hours. At the end of 3 hours, it was nearly as thick as my stove-top version, but it had that awful overcooked taste that I find typical of slow cooker recipes. If you plan to try this, i would suggest cutting the recipe in half and doing a test run before committing to the full version. Thankfully, we have an abundant crop of figs this year so there's more to use. My conclusion, use the recipe ingredients as instructed but cook it the old fashioned way, on top of the stove (bring to a boil, reduce to a low simmer and cook for 40 to 50 minutes or until thick, stirring frequently toward the end to keep it from scorching).</td>

      <td>This is an old wives tale.  The best way to keep eggs from cracking when they boil is to temper them in hot water first to avoid thermal shock.  Cover the eggs in the pan with hot tap water and let them sit for 3-4 minutes.  Pour that water off and do it again.  Now the eggs are slightly warm and ready to boil - gently (turbulence can crack eggs too) - either the way described here, or boil them gently for exactly 12 minutes, then cool them immediately in ice water and peel under running tap water.  If you want your eggs to peel easier, use old eggs.  That&amp;#039;s right - OLD eggs.  if you plan to boil a bunch for Easter, buy them two weeks ahead of time, then store them in their carton flipped over on its side (read on).  The albumen (white) in new/fresher eggs has a lower PH which causes it to adhere to the inner shell membrane.  The PH is higher in older eggs, which makes them easier to peel.  DON&amp;#039;T USE VINEGAR - it lowers the PH, and that&amp;#039;s the exact opposite of what&amp;#039;s needed.  One-half teaspoon baking soda per quart of water will make it alkaline and could help a little to raise the PH on fresh eggs, but it can also intensify the sulfur flavor, so just stick with boiling older eggs for best results.  You can increase the odds of centered yolks by storing them in the refrigerator inside their carton that&amp;#039;s SET SIDEWAYS so the long axis of the eggs face east and west, instead of north and south.  Not completely reliable, but increases the odds of centered yolks.</td>

I thought this one sounded a little...different, but I'm always willing to try something once. With all of that said, this was absolutely AWFUL!!! No recipe should ever call for an entire glass of wine - not only that, but technically, how much is one glass even? It also calls for thyme, which I think could be left out - it's too potent of an ingredient and this recipe, just like the wine, calls for WAY too much. All of my ingredients were purchased the day I made it, the meat was fresh from a local meat market and I checked dates on all other ingredients. I can't even describe the taste, but it is disgusting - it tastes like it was made weeks ago and has gone bad, right after preparing and baking it. I think if the wine and thyme were completely left out, it would be a huge improvement and I'd be willing to try it without those things. It also wouldn't hurt to eliminate tomato paste altogether. There's no need for tomato paste in a meat, vegetable, and potato dish since it's not an Italian meal. This was supposed to be a meal that I could feed off from for a few days and heat up when I get hungry. Now I have to throw this whole thing out, waste ingredients and money, and make something else.</td>

It does have a fudgey flavor and the peanut butter stands out, so the pumpkin really didn't come through much. Although the recipe says the fudge does not taste "exactly" like fudge, the fudge was not really sweet enough to me, having a texture that reminded me of Play-dough" for some reason, with my husband describing it as "spongy".

Even after baking it wasn&amp;#039;t absorbed properly and was too &amp;quot;soupy.&amp;quot; This is probably because the veggies weren&amp;#039;t able to absorb the liquid given their post-boiled state, and the starch had been boiled out of the potatoes.\n4) The sauce is BLAND. Not enough salt/seasoning.\n5) The whole dish is bland! Not enough salt/seasoning. Maybe not enough cheese? The gruyere was lost in the mess.

First...I am SURE the RR has garlic.  Additionally, RR is BAKED with the cheese on top.  There are no baking instructions on this CC.  And adding WINE to dairy??  Only causes curdling.  IMO, you're probably supposed to add the wine to the butter &amp; shallots.  This has virtually no flavor and reminded me of a plain bechamel with shrimp, artichokes, &amp; spinach.

Guess we just prefer our deviled eggs made with salad dressing rather than with the mayonnaise. Also, when adding the relish, I much prefer a sweet relish rather than the dill pickle relish. The dill relish is a bit salty in taste, so I omitted the salt, and I'm glad I did, or these eggs would of been much too salty to eat. If you let these sit for several hours, you can really taste the relish in the eggs. Also, when it came to adding the mustard, I used a yellow mustard, but I really couldn't taste the mustard in the eggs. One more thing, I cut the recipe down and just used 8 eggs instead of the dozen, and the amount of ingredients I used was... 1/3 cup of mayonnaise, 3/4 teaspoon of yellow mustard, 2 tablespoons of the dill pickle relish, and a light sprinkle of paprika on each egg.

I would definitely cut down on the Nutmeg by at least half and possibly even entirely omit the Allspice, that much Nutmeg and Allspice is not necessary to give flavor, to be honest. The Allspice was so overpowering that the aftertaste lingered for so long after finishing the muffin, Cinnamon would have definitely been a better substitute, as others have said. After all -- they are called Cinnamon Muffins. I agree with other reviewers that they were very dense, and borderline dry, and definitely not the texture I expect from a muffin. I'd have to drink an entire glass of milk to get one down. I prefer my muffins the traditional way -- fluffy and soft. True, it did make 12 muffins, though -- 12 mini muffins. Also the Cinnamon Sugar topping does not make them Cinnamon Muffins -- they should be called Allspice Muffins, since that is the main flavor. Sorry to say, but with all the tweaks I'd have to make to enjoy them, I figure I might as well find an entirely different recipe that suits my tastes. So, no, I will not be making them again.</td>

Had it been the last item in the ingredient list it would make more sense.  Instead I melted the butter when I first started to make this and poured it in the bottom of the pan before putting the bread in.

      <td>What a disappointment.  It sounded like it would be so yummy, but it was bad.  First, the colors are all the same - sort of a pale yellow - except for the walnuts and ham.  Not appetizing at all, and you couldn&amp;#039;t tell whether you had picked up a chunk of apple or a cube of mozzarella.  I made a balsamic vinaigrette that was good, but the rest of the salad was sooo bland.  Walnuts tend to be a little bitter, and it really came out in this salad.  The mozzarella was a very mild taste.  The apples were sweet, and the ham salty, but it just didn&amp;#039;t go with the rest.  If I took the idea, but made it so it would be palatable, I would use Romaine lettuce, Swiss cheese, red pepper, and maybe some toasted almond slivers.  So sad that I have to throw the rest of this out.  What a waste.</td>

It not like you will be spitting it out, but you will be bored.  Skip this recipe and try something else.</td>

From the beginning the recipe is plaques with inaccuracies because it takes me a lot longer than 15 minutes to soften the veggies especially the carrots which didn&amp;#039;t soften immediately.   It taken me about an hour and half to soften the veggies.  Also someone need to kitchen test this recipe because I think someone forgot a large part of the recipe.

I have always used the recipe of Better Crocker until now, and while the ingredients are the same, the temperature BC uses is 325 degrees and bake for for 30 minutes.  You will avoid having the tassies cooking too fast and getting too brown on the bottom and sides before the filling is done.  I am really disappointed because these cost a lot of money to make and they are totally ruined.</td>

      <td>I am not sure if the rest of you have made gazes before, especially for cinnamon rolls...but, this recipe was terrible!  The butter added a darker color than preferred and the consistency was gritty....I know how to cook, bake, and follow recipes but I had to try this more than once after reading the reviews.  However, both times I did not like the darker color due to the butter and the grittiness even with the softest/most sifted powdered sugar.  In addition, either wit OJ or milk, or both, or adding it gradually/drizzling it in/it just did not matter!  It was thick and DID NOT harden as cooled..... by the way, removing the butter really helped a lot!!!!  YOU CAN ALSO use cream cheese instead of butter or eliminate it all together......also, you can replace the OJ and/or milk with just water.  SO basically, you end up with an easier recipe of powdered sugar, vanilla, and water or milk.....much much better!!!!!  Nice and clearish white glaze, perfectly drizzible consistency and DOES harden as it cools....when warmed back up, it melts perfectly again just like the original application!  Do not attempt this recipe, it is a waste of time and butter LOL</td>

I was hoping that adding more milk would fix it; don't do that. It made it WORSE. It just became this weird liquid with grits of sugar in it. At some point, there began to be some form of spongy material arising in the mixture that I could not stir out. After I got it the best I could, I STRAINED OUT THE SPONGY STUFF and poured this over my baked goods and they ABSORBED THE MIXTURE. I then had a very unattractive, soggy treat that I didn't know what to do with. I had been excited about the recipe of the baked goods I made, and I messed up by not reading the reviews to find out about the major fail that was this recipe. No offense, but it just doesn't work. At least not for me, and I did everything the way it said to.</td>

I thought this recipe would be the same, and that the lamb would just fall off the bone. It did not. Even after the full cook time I thought i would be able to shred it, but i could not. It was just a big lamb leg sitting in a pot of sauce basically. I mean, maybe im confused, is this how people eat it?? Also, I got a 3lb leg for my husband and me. It was barely enough meat just for me. THe fact that this recipe says 5 lbs for 8 people is crazy. Lamb legs are about $8 per pound and there is not a ton of meat on them. For 8 people I would say you need 6 or 7 lbs for people to get good chunks with their orzo. I had to take the leg off and then cut off the meat, chop it up and put it in the pot. it was a pain. if people give me reccomendations that would be great. I bumped in to a chef at whole foods who told me to use a lamb shank... maybe ill try that next time. I was very disappointed.</td>

However, the flour, butter and milk/cream mixture was way too much for the 4 cups of cheddar cheese. The cheese barely turned the flour/milk mixture a pale orange color and it only tasted faintly like cheese as it cooked. So, I kept adding more cheese and more cheese and more cheese...... I mixed the macaroni into the cheese mixture and baked it per the instructions.  Even though it tasted bland, I ate some for dinner since I hadn't defrosted anything else and really didn't feel like cooking somethig else after this ordeal. But, it was barely edible - I could barely taste the cheese. So, the remainder of the 16 ounces of macaroni and all that cheese went down the disposal. Next time, I'll buy a box of Kraft mac &amp; cheese. It may not be good, but at least you can taste the cheese.</td>

      <td>It was a bland type of baked macaroni. If you like more flavor I would suggest using sharp cheddar and another fresh grated cheese of your choice along with some spices. The only changes I made was adding grated cheddar on top and mixing Italian bread crumbs with a butter flavored cracker for baked top (out of panko). It really kinda reminds me of Stoffers but more work and dry. I decided to try due to what I had for cheese, but I will stick to my baked macaroni recipe in the future . If you rated this high I would have to think you don't have a lot of experience cooking and trying baked macaroni and/or your pallet is very bland. Thank you.</td>

I have made white sauces before and I understand how they must be treated. I used the prescribed 4 cups of cheese. I used the called-for salt and pepper. I stirred and stirred and stirred so not to burn the sauce. The colour of the cheese sauce was dark grey, not the colour of the cheese at all. I don&amp;#039;t know what happened, but it was the most bland, non-cheesy tasting mac-n-cheese I&amp;#039;ve ever baked. The buttered bread crumbs were dusty and disgusting. The whole thing was dry and without flavour. I checked the recipe to make sure I hadn&amp;#039;t omitted anything, but the flavour was definitely NOT there. I followed the recipe to the T. I made no additions nor did I tweak any ingredients. I chose this recipe because I have made other recipes from the Fannie Farmer cookbook and REALLY loved them! This was served at my Christmas dinner and I was  really embarrassed that almost no one finished their serving. When I tasted it, I understood why. I don&amp;#039;t know what happened, but I will NOT be making this again.</td>

      <td>Well, when I first saw this recipe, I was confused by it right from the off. The cooking time - one hundred minutes - seemed far too long. From what I've seen of curry preparation, the dishes should take no more than forty-five minutes to prepare. So that was odd, I thought, but then I thought, &amp;quot;Hey, I'm sure this person knows what they're talking about, so I'll take their word for it.&amp;quot; WHAT a mistake that was... I have to admit that the first three stages are valid. Fry the meat for ten; okay. Fry the onion mixture until golden; okay. Make the curry paste; okay. But as soon as you've got to that stage, stop following the recipe immediately; stop, stop-stop-stop, STOP, or you WILL get a burned pile of trash at the end, I PROMISE you. Once you've made the curry paste, combine it with all of the other ingredients in the casserole dish, and transfer that straight into the pre-heated oven. Now cook that in there for fifteen minutes, and the dish should turn out fine. DO NOT make the mistake that I did, of following the entire overkill recipe, and cooking every little seperate component in the pan first, before moving it to the oven and cooking it in there for the FAR too lengthy time of forty-five minutes. When I did all that, I got a charred, inedible pile of blackness at the end. So all in all, this recipe gets one star out of five from me, because to follow it is to essentially throw nice ingredients down the drain.</td>

The actual making and presentation of the balls was easy and I followed the recipe to the letter-and I double checked I got everything right. It was basically condensed milk and coconut flavours which overpowered everything else, essentially they were sweet and fatty which may be good for the masses but definitely not good for a few friends and this recipe made 96! You would be far better off with a dash of lime in the recipe and substitute out most of the condensed milk to replace with something else less sweet.

Many comments said it was too spicy and you couldn't taste any other flavors. Based on that I cut the Tabasco down to 1 tsp, because I could always add more and skipped the cayenne. That being said, this potato salad still has a strong bite to it and I don't think that is the fault of the hot sauce. (I'll pour Tabasco all over a burrito and then add more as I'm eating.) I think the powdered mustard and the raw onion kill this recipe. I'm hoping it will tone down after some chilling. If you look at the spices here and compare them with a real jerk blend recipe, you'll see some major components are missing. Paprika, cinnamon, nutmeg, black pepper, garlic powder onion and potentially sugar cumin and/or parsley depending on your recipe. Allspice and thyme are a slight jerk suggestion here. No idea why all the mustard and turmeric are added at all. I'm going to attempt to doctor this up, but would never make this particular recipe again.</td>

      <td>I was raised in Springfield Illinois and my great grandmother worked at the Leland hotel in the late 20's along side the creator of the Horseshoe Sandwich. She passed it to my grandmother who passed it to me. The original is served on a sizzling metal plate (known as the Anvil) the 2 thick cut slices of bread were toasted and added the the plate. Then a thick slice of ham was added shaped like a horseshoe, to it a Welsh rarbit cheese sauce made of white sharp cheddar, then just before serving shoestring fries were added as the (nails) in the horseshoe. This sandwich was created for the hungry horseman that used to frequent Springfield, many sandwich combinations were created and this was the one that the men loved best. It was not an after thought at the Red Coach. Many years after it was created at the Leland Hotel, Steve Tomko a co creator brought the recipe to Wayne Coombs at  Wayne's red coach inn which by the way Wayne did not open until 1971! Hopeful is hopeless, wrong story and wrong cheese sauce, no one but Betty Crocker would try to use Velveeta (which isn't even cheese) in a rarebit cheese sauce. Ron is absolutely correct sharp white cheddar only. There are a few other things wrong with this knock of recipe. While I love the horseshoe sandwich and all of its many varieties of meat, bread, French fry, and as you can see cheese choices I cannot give this particular recipe high stars. It's almost as bad as the lady who said she used a powdered cheese to make her sauce. This is like putting a homemade five cheese mac n cheese next to a .35 box of Kraft powdered cheese mac n cheese. While both are Mac and cheese one is far superior. That is why I cannot give this a higher star rating.</td>

Maybe I over did the drying process but I cut it thin (as requested in the recipe) and there wasn't any other option than wet or dry. \r\n\r\nThird, my brother said it tasted like gingerbread jerky. It was a mild flavor, the small amount of spicy wasn't enough to make up for the lack of any defining flavor. Even the beef flavor was muted from all the boiling. I thought it tasted a little like chai but that was reaching. Even the smell wasn't appealing.\r\n\r\nLastly, I was thinking of throwing it away when my cats started to rip open the bag of it I had left on the table.

Instructions never make reference to this.  Assume I add it when adding the TVP?\n2.  Instruction #4 refers to a 'prepared pan' - assume this means sprayed with Pam???\n3. Instruction #5 says to 'sprinkle half the soy cheese blend...' - there is no instruction regarding the soy mozzarella.  I am assuming it's to be grated, but what's this about a 'blend'???  Is it supposed to be mixed with something that the ingredients list doesn't include?\n4. I just went to your website to check this recipe's instructions there.  Very different, hmm?  That version lists only a half cup of TVP (vs this recipe's 2/3 cup) and says to soak it in 1 cup of hot water.  It has only 1/2 tsp salt vs this one's 1 tsp.  That version lists a mixture of soy mozz and parm, this one only lists soy mozz.  \nYour site's instructions say to add the soaked TVP to the cooked veg - seems like soaking is kind of a critical step here?  \nI am hoping this recipe comes out ok since the soy mozz cost $8 alone.

(I also added a dash or orange oil) one last note, Gram crackers make a acceptable substitute if your short on vanilla cookies... and I bet shortbread cookies would be delicious to use also.</td>

      <td>A friend passed this recipe to me via email. I LOVE apples and brie together, so I just knew that I would love this recipe. Boy, was I WRONG! I have never doubted a Taste of Home recipe before because I have never had a bad one. Some, we prefer over others, and some I may not make on a regular basis, but, they are always noteworthy. The recipe lister even gave it rave reviews, so I decided to make it for a special luncheon for two of my friends. I know that not trying a recipe before serving it was stupid, but, since it was TOH, I did it. There was just too much going on in the sandwich. If I ever tried to make a similar version of this again, I would leave out the walnuts, or use a more bland nut. They ruined the delicate flavors of the brie and apple combination. I grow several types of rosemary, so I made two batches of this recipe. The first was with a fragrant rosemary, and the second was with a lemon rosemary. The lemon rosemary won, hands down. I would also leave off the prosciutto, as even thinly sliced, it did not meld flavor wise. Plus, it was kinda expensive to make, so by leaving off the meat and the walnuts, it would cut costs considerably, and still provide the spirit of the sandwich. In all fairness, I did make up the sandwiches about an hour ahead of time, so that I could spend more time with my guests. Next time, to make my version of the sandwich, I would combine the lemon rosemary, and parmesan with a small dot of butter. I would brush that across the inside, before layering the apples, and brie. I would then finely chop a small bit of additional rosemary, and brush the outside of the sandwiches with olive oil, and then sprinkle with the diced rosemary. I would increase the amount of apple, and perhaps even get them carmelizing in a pan before I started putting them on the sandwich. Have to play with that idea some. Then serve with a fresh green salad, or lightly chilled soup. The sandwich was just very heavy tasting with overbearing flavors that did not meld as well as we would have hoped. Thank goodness, it was only friends eating the sandwiches, and they were "polite" in their reviews.</td>

Also the recipe never states where to add the mushrooms. The lack of salt and pepper leaves the result absolutely tasteless and the over-use of basil and oregano doesn't make up for it. The "sauce" it makes using 4 tablespoons of corn starch is wayyyyy too thick to be confused with traditional Shrimp Scampi. If you insist on using this recipe, a lot of adjustments need to be made. Just not worth it!</td>

      <td>This cake was super easy. After reading all the positive reviews, I looked forward to making it. And then after reading the negative (cake was already in the oven), slightly worried about my cake. I was reassured when I took it out of the oven, and all seemed to be well, if I had left a review right then, it would have been a good one. Sigh, I sincerely hate to leave bad reviews, but this just didn't work. Everything seemed fine at first, I followed the directions exactly, and everything looked good. After letting the cake cool, I went back into the kitchen to frost it, here is where it all fell apart, literally. I don't mean that the cake split in half, or a chunk of the corner fell off, I mean the entire thing CRUMBLED. It was like powder. I am not new to baking. I have many years of cakes under my belt. I have had many disastrous outcomes. As well as many delicious ones. This was unlike anything I have ever seen. Boyfriend said, "It's kind of like corn bread." And I guess that would be the best way to describe it, except cornbread is dense, this was like...old foam. The green kind they used to put in fake potted plants, that just crumbled into dust after 20 years in the sun. I have no idea how it went from looking so good to corn bread cake dust in just a few hours. I'm sorry, it was just a complete fail. :(</td>

      <td>There are so many things wrong with this recipe.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First off, a "Traditional" Martini has a large vermouth to gin ratio.  This is a dry (probably even an extra dry) martini.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Second, the gin shouldn't be shaken.  I won't call it bruising like a lot of cocktail aficionados, but shaking the gin hurts your martini in two ways.  First, it results in a cloudy, dirty-looking drink, and nobody wants a dirty martini without olive juice.  Second, it gets the gin too cold.  Stirring should chill the gin to a cold temperature while still retaining the flavor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;If you like this recipe, you do not like martinis.  You like over-chilled gin.</td>

It made a mess in the cooking chamber, which anyone who has an Easy Bake Oven knows is very difficult to clean. Obviously this recipe does not work with all brands and varieties of cake mixes.
